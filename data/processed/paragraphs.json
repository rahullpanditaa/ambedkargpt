All these stocks of people came into India from various directions and  with  various  cultures,  centuries  ago,  when  they  were  in  a  tribal  state. They  all  in  turn  elbowed  their  entry  into  the  country  by  fighting  with  their predecessors, and after a stomachful of it settled down as peaceful neighbours. Through  constant  contact  and  mutual  intercourse  they  evolved  a  common culture  that  superseded  their  distinctive  cultures.  It  may  be  granted  that there has not been a thorough amalgamation of the various stocks that make up  the  peoples  of  India,  and  to  a  traveller  from  within  the  boundaries  of India  the  East  presents  a  marked  contrast  in  physique  and  even  in  colour to  the  West,  as  does  the  South  to  the  North.  But  amalgamation  can  never be  the  sole  criterion  of  homogeneity  as  predicated  of  any  people.  Ethnically all  people  are  heterogeneous.  It  is  the  unity  of  culture  that  is  the  basis  of homogeneity. Taking this for granted, I venture to say that there is no country that  can  rival  the  Indian  Peninsula  with  respect  to  the  unity  of  its  culture. It  has  not  only  a  geographic  unity,  but  it  has  over  and  above  all  a  deeper and  a  much  more  fundamental  unity\u2014the  indubitable  cultural  unity  that covers  the  land  from  end  to  end.  But  it  is  because  of  this  homogeneity  that Caste  becomes  a  problem  so  difficult  to  be  explained.  If  the  Hindu  Society were  a  mere  federation  of  mutually  exclusive  units,  the  matter  would  be simple  enough.  But  Caste  is  a  parcelling  of  an  already  homogeneous  unit, and the explanation of the genesis of Caste is the explanation of this process of  parcelling."

By  way  of  criticism, therefore,  I  will  take  only  those  points  common  to  all  Castes  in  each  of  the above  definitions  which  are  regarded  as  peculiarities  of  Caste  and  evaluate them  as  such."

With  regard  to  this  point  it  may  be  safely  said that  it  is  by  no  means  a  peculiarity  of  Caste  as  such.  It  usually  originates in  priestly  ceremonialism  and  is  a  particular  case  of  the  general  belief  in purity. Consequently its necessary connection with Caste may be completely denied  without  damaging  the  working  of  Caste.  The  \u201cidea  of  pollution\u201d  has been attached to the institution of Caste, only because the Caste that enjoys the highest rank is the priestly Caste : while we know that priest and purity are  old  associates.  We  may  therefore  conclude  that  the  \u201cidea  of  pollution\u201d is  a  characteristic  of  Caste  only  in  so  far  as  Caste  has  a  religious  flavour."

In  spite  of  the  newness  of  the  point we must say that Mr. Nesfield has mistaken the effect for the cause. Caste, being  a  self-enclosed  unit  naturally  limits  social  intercourse,  including messing  etc.  to  members  within  it.  Consequently  this  absence  of  messing with  outsiders  is  not  due  to  positive  prohibition,  but  is  a  natural  result  of Caste, i.e. exclusiveness. No doubt this absence of messing originally due to exclusiveness,  acquired  the  prohibitory  character  of  a  religious  injunction, but it may be regarded as a later growth. Sir H.

Not  only  is  he  a  native,  but  he  has  also brought  a  critical  acumen  and  an  open  mind  to  bear  on  his  study  of  Caste. His  definition  merits  consideration,  for  he  has  defined  Caste  in  its  relation to  a  system  of  Castes,  and  has  concentrated  his  attention  only  on  those characteristics  which  are  absolutely  necessary  for  the  existence  of  a  Caste within a system, rightly excluding all others as being secondary or derivative in  character.  With  respect  to  his  definition  it  must,  however,  be  said  that in  it  there  is  a  slight  confusion  of  thought,  lucid  and  clear  as  otherwise  it is.  He  speaks  of  Prohibition  of  Intermarriage  and  Membership  by  Autogeny as  the  two  characteristics  of  Caste.  I  submit  that  these  are  but  two  aspects of  one  and  the  same  thing,  and  not  two  different  things  as  Dr.  Ketkar supposes  them  to  be.  If  you  prohibit  intermarriage  the  result  is  that  you limit  membership  to  those  born  within  the  group.  Thus  the  two  are  the obverse  and  the  reverse  sides  of  the  same  medal."

But some may deny this on abstract anthropological grounds, for there exist endogamous groups without giving rise to the problem of Caste. In a general way this may be true, as endogamous societies, culturally different, making  their  abode  in  localities  more  or  less  removed,  and  having  little  to do  with  each  other  are  a  physical  reality.  The  Negroes  and  the  Whites  and the various tribal groups that go by name of American Indians in the United States  may  be  cited  as  more  or  less  appropriate  illustrations  in  support  of this  view.  But  we  must  not  confuse  matters,  for  in  India  the  situation  is different.  As  pointed  out  before,  the  peoples  of  India  form  a  homogeneous whole. The various races of India occupying definite territories have more or less fused into one another and do possess cultural unity, which is the only criterion  of  a  homogeneous  population.

Its religion is essentially primitive and its tribal code, in spite of the advance of time and civilization, operates in all its pristine vigour even today. One of these primitive survivals, to which I wish particularly to draw  your  attention  is  the  Custom  of  Exogamy.  The  prevalence  of  exogamy in  the  primitive  worlds  is  a  fact  too  wellknown  to  need  any  explanation. With  the  growth  of  history,  however,  exogamy  has  lost  its  efficacy,  and excepting  the  nearest  blood-kins,  there  is  usually  no  social  bar  restricting the field of marriage. But regarding the peoples of India the law of exogamy is  a  positive  injunction  even  today.  Indian  society  still  savours  of  the  clan system,  even  though  there  are  no  clans ;  and  this  can  be  easily  seen  from the law of matrimony which centres round the principle of exogamy, for it is not  that  Sapindas  (blood-kins)  cannot  marry,  but  a  marriage  even  between Sagotras  (of  the  same  class)  is  regarded  as  a  sacrilege."

It  is  no  exaggeration  to  say  that  with  the  people  of  India exogamy  is  a  creed  and  none  dare  infringe  it,  so  much  so  that,  in  spite  of the  endogamy  of  the  Castes  within  them,  exogamy  is  strictly  observed  and that there are more rigorous penalties for violating exogamy than there are for  violating  endogamy.  You  will,  therefore,  readily  see  that  with  exogamy as the rule there could be no Caste, for exogamy means fusion. But we have castes ; consequently in the final analysis creation of Castes, so far as India is  concerned,  means  the  superposition  of  endogamy  on  exogamy.  However, in  an  originally  exogamous  population  an  easy  working  out  of  endogamy (which  is  equivalent  to  the  creation  of  Caste)  is  a  grave  problem,  and  it  is in  the  consideration  of  the  means  utilized  for  the  preservation  of  endogamy against  exogamy  that  we  may  hope  to  find  the  solution  of  our  problem."

Consequently  every  surplus  woman  cannot  thus  be  disposed  of,  because  it is  an  easy  solution  but  a  hard  realization.  And  so  the  surplus  woman  (= widow),  if  not  disposed  of,  remains  in  the  group :  but  in  her  very  existence lies a double danger. She may marry outside the Caste and violate endogamy, or she may marry within the Caste and through competition encroach upon the  chances  of  marriage  that  must  be  reserved  for  the  potential  brides  in the  Caste.  She  is  therefore  a  menance  in  any  case,  and  something  must be  done  to  her  if  she  cannot  be  burned  along  with  her  deceased  husband."

So  far  as  the  objective  results  are  concerned,  burning  is  a  better  solution than enforcing widowhood. Burning the widow eliminates all the three evils that  a  surplus  woman  is  fraught  with.  Being  dead  and  gone  she  creates  no problem  of  remarriage  either  inside  or  outside  the  Caste.  But  compulsory widowhood  is  superior  to  burning  because  it  is  more  practicable.  Besides being  comparatively  humane  it  also  guards  against  the  evils  of  remarriage as  does  burning;  but  it  fails  to  guard  the  morals  of  the  group.  No  doubt under  compulsory  widowhood  the  woman  remains,  and  just  because  she  is deprived of her natural right of being a legitimate wife in future, the incentive to  immoral  conduct  is  increased.  But  this  is  by  no  means  an  insuperable difficulty.  She  can  be  degraded  to  a  condition  in  which  she  is  no  longer  a source  of  allurement."

Under  these  circumstances  he may  be  forced  or  I  should  say  induced,  after  the  manner  of  the  widow,  to remain  a  widower  for  the  rest  of  his  life.  This  solution  is  not  altogether difficult,  for  without  any  compulsion  some  are  so  disposed  as  to  enjoy  self- imposed  celibacy,  or  even  to  take  a  further  step  of  their  own  accord  and renounce  the  world  and  its  joys.  But,  given  human  nature  as  it  is,  this solution  can  hardly  be  expected  to  be  realized.  On  the  other  hand,  as  is very  likely  to  be  the  case,  if  the  surplus  man  remains  in  the  group  as  an active  participator  in  group  activities,  he  is  a  danger  to  the  morals  of  the group.  Looked  at  from  a  different  point  of  view  celibacy,  though  easy  in cases  where  it  succeeds,  is  not  so  advantageous  even  then  to  the  material prospects  of  the  Caste.  If  he  observes  genuine  celibacy  and  renounces  the world,  he  would  not  be  a  menace  to  the  preservation  of  Caste  endogamy  or Caste  morals  as  he  undoubtedly  would  be  if  he  remained  a  secular  person. But  as  an  ascetic  celibate  he  is  as  good  as  burned,  so  far  as  the  material well-being  of  his  Caste  is  concerned.  A  Caste,  in  order  that  it  may  be  large enough to afford a vigorous communal life, must be maintained at a certain numerical strength. But to hope for this and to proclaim celibacy is the same as  trying  to  cure  atrophy  by  bleeding."

But  the  problem  is  to  provide  him  with  a  wife  from  within  the  Caste.  At the  outset  this  is  not  possible,  for  the  ruling  ratio  in  a  caste  has  to  be  one man  to  one  woman  and  none  can  have  two  chances  of  marriage,  for  in  a Caste  thoroughly  self-enclosed  there  are  always  just  enough  marriageable women  to  go  round  for  the  marriageable  men.  Under  these  circumstances the  surplus  man  can  be  provided  with  a  wife  only  by  recruiting  a  bride from  the  ranks  of  those  not  yet  marriageable  in  order  to  tie  him  down  to the  group.  This  is  certainly  the  best  of  the  possible  solutions  in  the  case of  the  surplus  man.  By  this,  he  is  kept  within  the  Caste.

My  own interpretation  is  that  they  were  honoured  because  they  were  practised. Any  one  slightly  acquainted  with  rise  of  individualism  in  the  18th  century will  appreciate  my  remark.  At  all  times,  it  is  the  movement  that  is  most important; and the philosophies grow around it long afterwards to justify it and  give  it  a  moral  support.  In  like  manner  I  urge  that  the  very  fact  that these  customs  were  so  highly  eulogized  proves  that  they  needed  eulogy  for their  prevalence.  Regarding  the  question  as  to  why  they  arose,  I  submit that  they  were  needed  to  create  the  structure  of  caste  and  the  philosophies in  honour  of  them  were  intended  to  popularize  them,  or  to  gild  the  pill, as  we  might  say,  for  they  must  have  been  so  abominable  and  shocking  to the  moral  sense  of  the  unsophisticated  that  they  needed  a  great  deal  of sweetening. These customs are essentially of the nature of means, though they are  represented  as  ideals.  But  this  should  not  blind  us  from  understanding the  results  that  flow  from  them.  One  might  safely  say  that  idealization  of means  is  necessary  and  in  this  particular  case  was  perhaps  motivated  to endow  them  with  greater  efficacy.  Calling  a  means  an  end  does  no  harm, except  that  it  disguises  its  real  character ;  but  it  does  not  deprive  it  of  its real  nature,  that  of  a  means.  You  may  pass  a  law  that  all  cats  are  dogs, just  as  you  can  call  a  means  an  end.  But  you  can  no  more  change  the nature  of  means  thereby  than  you  can  turn  cats  into  dogs;  consequently  I am  justified  in  holding  that,  whether  regarded  as  ends  or  as  means,  Sati, enforced  widowhood  and  girl  marriage  are  customs  that  were  primarily intended  to  solve  the  problem  of  the  surplus  man  and  surplus  woman  in  a caste and to maintain its endogamy. Strict endogamy could not be preserved without  these  customs,  while  caste  without  endogamy  is  a  fake."

The question  may  seem  too  inquisitorial,  but  it  is  pertinent,  and  an  answer  to this  will  serve  us  to  elucidate  the  mystery  of  the  growth  and  development of  castes  all  over  India.  Unfortunately  a  direct  answer  to  this  question  is not  within  my  power.  I  can  answer  it  only  indirectly.  I  said  just  above  that the  customs  in  question  were  current  in  the  Hindu  society.  To  be  true  to facts  it  is  necessary  to  qualify  the  statement,  as  it  connotes  universality  of their prevalence. These customs in all their strictness are obtainable only in one caste, namely the Brahmins, who occupy the highest place in the social hierarchy of the Hindu society ; and as their prevalence in non-Brahmin castes is derivative of their observance is neither strict nor complete. This important fact  can  serve  as  a  basis  of  an  important  observation.  If  the  prevalence  of these  customs  in  the  non-Brahmin  Castes  is  derivative,  as  can  be  shown very  easily,  then  it  needs  no  argument  to  prove  what  class  is  the  father  of the  institution  of  caste.  Why  the  Brahmin  class  should  have  enclosed  itself into  a  caste  is  a  different  question,  which  may  be  left  as  an  employment for  another  occasion.

Every  country  has  its law-giver, who arises as an incarnation (avatar) in times of emergency to set right a sinning humanity and give it the laws of justice and morality. Manu, the  law-giver  of  India,  if  he  did  exist,  was  certainly  an  audacious  person.  If the  story  that  he  gave  the  law  of  caste  be  credited,  then  Manu  must  have been  a  dare-devil  fellow  and  the  humanity  that  accepted  his  dispensation must be a humanity quite different from the one we are acquainted with. It is unimaginable that the law of caste was given. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that Manu could not have outlived his law, for what is that class that can submit to be degraded to the status of brutes by the pen of a man, and suffer  him  to  raise  another  class  to  the  pinnacle ?  Unless  he  was  a  tyrant who  held  all  the  population  in  subjection  it  cannot  be  imagined  that  he could  have  been  allowed  to  dispense  his  patronage  in  this  grossly  unjust manner,  as  may  be  easily  seen  by  a  mere  glance  at  his  \u201cInstitutes\u201d.  I  may seem  hard  on  Manu.  but  I  am  sure  my  force  is  not  strong  enough  to  kill his  ghost.  He  lives,  like  a  disembodied  spirit  and  is  appealed  to,  and  I  am afraid will yet live long. One thing I want to impress upon you is that Manu did  not  give  the  law  of  Caste  and  that  he  could  not  do  so.  Caste  existed long  before  Manu.  He  was  an  upholder  of  it  and  therefore  philosophised about  it,  but  certainly  he  did  not  and  could  not  ordain  the  present  order  of Hindu  Society.  His  work  ended  with  the  codification  of  existing  caste  rules and  the  preaching  of  Caste  Dharma.  The  spread  and  growth  of  the  Caste system  is  too  gigantic  a  task  to  be  achieved  by  the  power  or  cunning  of  an individual or of a class. Similar in argument is the theory that the Brahmins created  the  Caste.  After  what  I  have  said  regarding  Manu,  I  need  hardly say  anything  more,  except  to  point  out  that  it  is  incorrect  in  thought  and malicious  in  intent.  The  Brahmins  may  have  been  guilty  of  many  things, and I dare say they were, but the imposing of the caste system on the non- Brahmin  population  was  beyond  their  mettle.  They  may  have  helped  the process  by  their  glib  philosophy,  but  they  certainly  could  not  have  pushed their  scheme  beyond  their  own  confines.  To  fashion  society  after  one\u2019s  own pattern  !  How  glorious  !  How  hard  !  One  can  take  pleasure  and  eulogize its  furtherance,  but  cannot  further  it  very  far.  The  vehemence  of  my  attack may  seem  to  be  unnecessary ;  but  I  can  assure  you  that  it  is  not  uncalled for. There is a strong belief in the mind of orthodox Hindus that the Hindu Society was somehow moulded into the framework of the Caste System and that it is an organization consciously created by the Shastras. Not only does this  belief  exist,  but  it  is  being  justified  on  the  ground  that  it  cannot  but be  good,  because  it  is  ordained  by  the  Shastras  and  the  Shastras  cannot be  wrong.  I  have  urged  so  much  on  the  adverse  side  of  this  attitude,  not because  the  religious  sanctity  is  grounded  on  scientific  basis,  nor  to  help those  reformers  who  are  preaching  against  it.

My  answer  is  because  the  Brahmins  were  so. Endogamy or the closed-door system, was a fashion in the Hindu society, and  as  it  had  originated  from  the  Brahmin  caste  it  was  whole-heartedly imitated  by  all  the  non-Brahmin  sub-divisions  or  classes,  who,  in  their turn,  became  endo gamous  castes.

One of his three laws is that imitation flows from the higher to the lower or, to quote his own words, \u201cGiven the opportunity, a nobility will always  and  everywhere  imitate  its  leaders,  its  kings  or  sovereigns,  and  the people likewise, given the opportunity, its nobility.\u201d4 Another of Tarde\u2019s laws of  imitation  is :  that  the  extent  or  intensity  of  imitation  varies  inversely  in proportion to distance, or in his own words \u201cThe thing that is most imitated is  the  most  superior  one  of  those  that  are  nearest.  In  fact,  the  influence of  the  model\u2019s  example  is  efficacious  inversely  to  its  distance  as  well  as directly  to  its  superiority.  Distance  is  understood  here  in  its  sociological meaning.  However  distant  in  space  a  stranger  may  be,  he  is  close  by,  from this  point  of  view,  if  we  have  numerous  and  daily  relations  with  him  and if  we  have  every  facility  to  satisfy  our  desire  to  imitate  him.  This  law  of the  imitation  of  the  nearest,  of  the  least  distant,  explains  the  gradual  and consecutive  character  of  the  spread  of  an  example  that  has  been  set  by  the higher  social  ranks.\u201d5"

The  conditions  for  imitation,  according  to  this  standard authority are : (1) that the source of imitation must enjoy prestige in the group and  (2)  that  there  must  be  \u201cnumerous  and  daily  relations\u201d  among  members of a group. That these conditions were present in India there is little reason to  doubt.  The  Brahmin  is  a  semi-god  and  very  nearly  a  demi-god.  He  sets up  a  mode  and  moulds  the  rest.  His  prestige  is  unquestionable  and  is  the fountain-head of bliss and good. Can such a being, idolised by scriptures and venerated  by  the  priest-ridden  multitude,  fail  to  project  his  personality  on the  suppliant  humanity ?  Why,  if  the  story  be  true,  he  is  believed  to  be  the very end of creation. Such a creature is worthy of more than mere imitation, but at least of imitation ; and if he lives in an endogamous enclosure, should not the rest follow his example ? Frail humanity! Be it embodied in a grave philosopher  or  a  frivolous  housemaid,  it  succumbs.  It  cannot  be  otherwise. Imitation  is  easy  and  invention  is  difficult."

In a way, but only in a way, the status of a caste in the Hindu Society varies directly with the extent of the observance of the customs of Sati, enforced widowhood, and girl marriage. But observance of  these  customs  varies  directly  with  the  distance  (I  am  using  the  word  in the  Tardian  sense)  that  separates  the  caste.  Those  castes  that  are  nearest to the Brahmins have imitated all the three customs and insist on the strict observance thereof. Those that are less near have imitated enforced widowhood and  girl  marriage ;  others,  a  little  further  off,  have  only  girl  marriage  and those  furthest  off  have  imitated  only  the  belief  in  the  caste  principle.  This imperfect  imitation,  I  dare  say,  is  due  partly  to  what  Tarde  calls  \u201cdistance\u201d and  partly  to  the  barbarous  character  of  these  customs.  This  phenomenon is a complete illustration of Tarde\u2019s law and leaves no doubt that the whole process of caste-formation in India is a process of imitation of the higher by the  lower.  At  this  juncture  I  will  turn  back  to  support  a  former  conclusion of  mine,  which  might  have  appeared  to  you  as  too  sudden  or  unsupported. I  said  that  the  Brahmin  class  first  raised  the  structure  of  caste  by  the help  of  those  three  customs  in  question.  My  reason  for  that  conclusion  was that  their  existence  in  other  classes  was  derivative.  After  what  I  have  said regarding  the  role  of  imitation  in  the  spread  of  these  customs  among  the non-Brahmin  castes,  as  means  or  as  ideals,  though  the  imitators  have  not been  aware  of  it,  they  exist  among  them  as  derivatives ;  and,  if  they  are derived,  there  must  have  been  prevalent  one  original  caste  that  was  high enough to have served as a pattern for the rest.

That this line of approach, as well as the psychological one, to the explanation of the subject has escaped my predecessors is entirely due to the fact that they have conceived caste as a unit by itself and not as one within a System of Caste. The result of this oversight or lack of sight has been very detrimental to the proper understanding of the subject matter and therefore its correct explanation. I will proceed to offer my own explanation by  making  one  remark  which  I  will  urge  you  to  bear  constantly  in  mind.  It is  this :  that  caste  in  the  singular  number  is  an  unreality.  Castes  exist  only in  the  plural  number.  There  is  no  such  thing  as  a  caste :  There  are  always castes. To illustrate my meaning : while making themselves into a caste, the Brahmins, by virtue of this, created non-Brahmin caste; or, to express it in my own way, while closing themselves in they closed others out. I will clear my point by taking another illustration. Take India as a whole with its various communities designated by the various creeds to which they owe allegiance, to  wit,  the  Hindus,  Mohammedans,  Jews,  Christians  and  Parsis.  Now, barring  the  Hindus,  the  rest  within  themselves  are  non-caste  communities."

Any innovation that seriously antagonises  the  ethical,  religious  and  social  code  of  the  Caste  is  not  likely to be tolerated by the Caste, and the recalcitrant members of a Caste are in danger  of  being  thrown  out  of  the  Caste,  and  left  to  their  own  fate  without having  the  alternative  of  being  admitted  into  or  absorbed  by  other  Castes. Caste  rules  are  inexorable  and  they  do  not  wait  to  make  nice  distinctions between  kinds  of  offence.  Innovation  may  be  of  any  kind,  but  all  kinds will  suffer  the  same  penalty.  A  novel  way  of  thinking  will  create  a  new Caste  for  the  old  ones  will  not  tolerate  it.  The  noxious  thinker  respectfully called  Guru  (Prophet)  suffers  the  same  fate  as  the  sinners  in  illegitimate love.  The  former  creates  a  caste  of  the  nature  of  a  religious  sect  and  the latter  a  type  of  mixed  caste.  Castes  have  no  mercy  for  a  sinner  who  has the  courage  to  violate  the  code.  The  penalty  is  excommunication  and  the result  is  a  new  caste.  It  is  not  peculiar  Hindu  psychology  that  induces the  excommunicated  to  form  themselves  into  a  caste ;  far  from  it.  On  the contrary,  very  often  they  have  been  quite  willing  to  be  humble  members  of some  caste  (higher  by  preference)  if  they  could  be  admitted  within  its  fold. But castes are enclosed units and it is their conspiracy with clear conscience that compels the excommunicated to make themselves into a caste. The logic of this obdurate circumstance is merciless, and it is in obedience to its force that  some  unfortunate  groups  find  themselves  enclosed,  because  others  in enclosing, themselves have closed them out, with the result that new groups (formed  on  any  basis  obnoxious  to  the  caste  rules)  by  a  mechanical  law  are constantly being converted into castes to a bewildering multiplicity.

It  is  true  that  Caste rests on belief, but before belief comes to be the foundation of an institution, the  institution  itself  needs  to  be  perpetuated  and  fortified.  My  study  of  the Caste  problem  involves  four  main  points :  (1)  that  in  spite  of  the  composite make-up  of  the  Hindu  population,  there  is  a  deep  cultural  unity;  (2)  that caste  is  a  parcelling  into  bits  of  a  larger  cultural  unit;  (3)  that  there  was one  caste  to  start  with  and  (4)  that  classes  have  become  Castes  through imitation  and  excommunication."

      "text": "The speech prepared by me for the Jat-Pat-Todak Mandal of Lahore has had an astonishingly warm reception from the Hindu public for whom it was primarily intended. The English edition of one thousand five hundred was exhausted within two months of its publication. It is translated into Gujarati and Tamil. It is being translated in Marathi, Hindi, Punjabi and Malayalam. The demand for the English text still continues unabated. To satisfy  this  demand  it  has  become  necessary  to  issue  a  Second  Edition. Considerations of history and effectiveness of appeal have led me to retain the original form of the essay\u2014namely the speech form\u2014although I was asked to recast it in the form of a direct narrative. To this edition I have added  two  appendices.  I  have  collected  in  Appendix  I  the  two  articles written  by  Mr.  Gandhi  by  way  of  review  of  my  speech  in  the  Harijan, and his letter to Mr. Sant Ram, a member of the Jat-Pat-Todak Mandal. In  Appendix  II,  I  have  printed  my  views  in  reply  to  the  articles  of  Mr. Gandhi  collected  in  Appendix  I.  Besides  Mr.  Gandhi  many  others  have adversely criticised my views as expressed in my speech. But I have felt that  in  taking  notice  of  such  adverse  comments  I  should  limit  myself  to Mr. Gandhi. This I have done not because what he has said is so weighty as  to  deserve  a  reply  but  because  to  many  a  Hindu  he  is  an  oracle,  so great that when he opens his lips it is expected that the argument must close  and  no  dog  must  bark.  But  the  world  owes  much  to  rebels  who would  dare  to  argue  in  the  face  of  the  pontiff  and  insist  that  he  is  not infallible.  I  do  not  care  for  the  credit  which  every  progressive  society"

You  will  remember  that  when  I  pointed  out  to  you  the misgivings entertained by some of our people regarding your declaration on the subject of change of religion, you told me that it was undoubtedly outside the scope of the Mandal and that you had no intention to say anything from our  platform  in  that  connection.  At  the  same  time  when  the  manuscript  of your  address  was  handed  to  me  you  assured  me  that  that  was  the  main portion  of  your  address  and  that  there  were  only  two  or  three  concluding paragraphs  that  you  wanted  to  add.  On  receipt  of  the  second  instalment of  your  address  we  have  been  taken  by  surprise,  as  that  would  make  it  so lengthy,  that  we  are  afraid,  very  few  people  would  read  the  whole  of  it. Besides  that  you  have  more  than  once  stated  in  your  address  that  you  had decided  to  walk  out  of  the  fold  of  the  Hindus  and  that  that  was  your  last address as a Hindu. You have also unnecessarily attacked the morality and reasonableness  of  the  Vedas  and  other  religious  books  of  the  Hindus,  and have  at  length  dwelt  upon  the  technical  side  of  Hindu  religion,  which  has absolutely  no  connection  with  the  problem  at  issue,  so  much  so  that  some of  the  passages  have  become  irrelevant  and  off  the  point.  We  would  have been  very  pleased  if  you  had  confined  your  address  to  that  portion  given to  me,  or  if  an  addition  was  necessary,  it  would  have  been  limited  to  what you  had  written  on  Brahminism  etc.  The  last  portion  which  deals  with the  complete  annihilation  of  Hindu  religion  and  doubts  the  morality  of  the sacred  books  of  the  Hindus  as  well  as  a  hint  about  your  intention  to  leave the  Hindu  fold  does  not  seem  to  me  to  be  relevant."

We doubt the wisdom of making the address unnecessarily provocative  and  pinching.

But  I  go  further  and  say  that  I  wrote  this  part  of  my address  not  merely  because  I  felt  it  desirable  to  do  so.  I  wrote  it  because I  thought  that  it  was  absolutely  necessary  to  complete  the  argument.

I  most  emphatically  maintain  that  the  portion objected to is not only most relevant but is also important. It is in that part of  the  address  that  I  have  discussed  the  ways  and  means  of  breaking  up the Caste System. It may be that the conclusion I have arrived at as to the best  method  of  destroying  Caste  is  startling  and  painful.  You  are  entitled to  say  that  my  analysis  is  wrong.

Otherwise  you  would have  known  that  originally  I  had  planned  to  write  a  short  address  for  my own convenience as I had neither the time nor the energy to engage myself in  the  preparation  of  an  elaborate  thesis.  It  was  the  Mandal  who  asked  me to  deal  with  the  subject  exhaustively  and  it  was  the  Mandal  which  sent down  to  me  a  list  of  questions  relating  to  the  Caste  System  and  asked  me to  answer  them  in  the  body  of  my  address  as  they  were  questions  which were often raised in the controversy between the Mandal and its opponents and  which  the  Mandal  found  difficult  to  answer  satisfactorily.  It  was  in trying to meet the wishes of the Mandal in this respect that the address has grown  to  the  length  to  which  it  has.

I  am sure  they  will  be  asked  many  questions  for  having  selected  me  as  the President. The Mandal will be asked to explain as to why it has imported a  man  from  Bombay  to  preside  over  a  function  which  is  held  in  Lahore. I  believe  the  Mandal  could  easily  have  found  some  one  better  qualified than  myself  to  preside  on  the  occasion.  I  have  criticised  the  Hindus.  I have  questioned  the  authority  of  the  Mahatma  whom  they  revere.  They hate  me.  To  them  I  am  a  snake  in  their  garden.  The  Mandal  will  no doubt  be  asked  by  the  politically-minded  Hindus  to  explain  why  it  has called  me  to  fill  this  place  of  honour.  It  is  an  act  of  great  daring.  I  shall not  be  surprised  if  some  political  Hindus  regard  it  as  an  insult.  This selection  of  mine  cannot  certainly  please  the  ordinary  religiously-minded Hindus.  The  Mandal  may  be  asked  to  explain  why  it  has  disobeyed  the Shastric  injunction  in  selecting  the  President.  Accoding  to  the  Shastras the  Brahmin  is  appointed  to  be  the  Guru  for  the  three  Varnas,  o.kkZuke czk\u00e3.kks  xq#,  is  a  direction  of  the  Shastras.  The  Mandal  therefore  knows from  whom  a  Hindu  should  take  his  lessons  and  from  whom  he  should not.  The  Shastras  do  not  permit  a  Hindu  to  accept  any  one  as  his  Guru merely  because  he  is  well-versed.  This  is  made  very  clear  by  Ramdas,  a Brahmin saint from Maharashtra, who is alleged to have inspired Shivaji to establish a Hindu Raj. In his Dasbodh, a socio-politico-religious treatise in Marathi verse Ramdas asks, addressing the Hindus, can we accept an Antyaja  to  be  our  Guru  because  he  is  a  Pandit  (i.e.  learned)  and  gives an  answer  in  the  negative.  What  replies  to  give  to  these  questions  is  a matter  which  I  must  leave  to  the  Mandal.  The  Mandal  knows  best  the reasons which led it to travel to Bombay to select a president, to fix upon a  man  so  repugnant  to  the  Hindus  and  to  descend  so  low  in  the  scale as  to  select  an  Antyaja\u2014  an  untouchable\u2014to  address  an  audience  of  the Savarnas. As for myself you will allow me to say that I have accepted the invitation  much  against  my  will  and  also  against  the  will  of  many  of  my fellow  untouchables.  I  know  that  the  Hindus  are  sick  of  me.  I  know  that I am not a persona grata with them. Knowing all this I have deliberately kept myself away from them. I have no desire to inflict myself upon them. I  have  been  giving  expression  to  my  views  from  my  own  platform.  This has  already  caused  a  great  deal  of  heartburning  and  irritation.  I  have no  desire  to  ascend  the  platform  of  the  Hindus  to  do  within  their  sight what  I  have  been  doing  within  their  hearing.  If  I  am  here  it  is  because of  your  choice  and  not  because  of  my  wish.  Yours  is  a  cause  of  social reform.  That  cause  has  always  made  an  appeal  to  me  and  it  is  because of  this  that  I  felt  I  ought  not  to  refuse  an  opportunity  of  helping  the cause  especially  when  you  think  that  I  can  help  it.  Whether  what  I  am"

It was due to  the  recognition  of  this  fact  that  the  birth  of  the  National  Congress  was accompanied by the foundation of the Social Conference. While the Congress was concerned with defining the weak points in the political organisation of the country, the Social Conference was engaged in removing the weak points in the social organisation of the Hindu Society. For some time the Congress and  the  Conference  worked  as  two  wings  of  one  common  activity  and  they held  their  annual  sessions  in  the  same  pandal.  But  soon  the  two  wings developed  into  two  parties,  a  Political  Reform  Party  and  a  Social  Reform Party, between whom there raged a fierce controversy. The Political Reform Party  supported  the  National  Congress  and  Social  Reform  Party  supported the  Social  Conference.  The  two  bodies  thus  became  two  hostile  camps.  The point  at  issue  was  whether  social  reform  should  precede  political  reform. For  a  decade  the  forces  were  evenly  balanced  and  the  battle  was  fought without  victory  to  either  side.  It  was  however  evident  that  the  fortunes  of the  Social  Conference  were  ebbing  fast.  The  gentlemen  who  presided  over the  sessions  of  the  Social  Conference  lamented  that  the  majority  of  the educated  Hindus  were  for  political  advancement  and  indifferent  to  social reform  and  that  while  the  number  of  those  who  attended  the  Congress  was very  large  and  the  number  who  did  not  attend  but  who  sympathized  with it even larger, the number of those who attended the Social Conference was very  much  smaller.  This  indifference,  this  thinning  of  its  ranks  was  soon followed  by  active  hostility  from  the  politicians.  Under  the  leadership  of the late Mr. Tilak, the courtesy with which the Congress allowed the Social Conference  the  use  of  its  pandal  was  withdrawn  and  the  spirit  of  enmity went  to  such  a  pitch  that  when  the  Social  Conference  desired  to  erect  its own pandal a threat to burn the pandal was held out by its opponents. Thus in  course  of  time  the  party  in  favour  of  political  reform  won  and  the  Social Conference  vanished  and  was  forgotten.  The  speech,  delivered  by  Mr.  W.C. Bonnerji  in  1892  at  Allahabad  as  President  of  the  eighth  session  of  the Congress, sounds like a funeral oration at the death of the Social Conference"

The  untouchable  was  required to have a black thread either on his wrist or in his neck as a sign or a mark to prevent the Hindus from getting themselves polluted by his touch through mistake. In Poona, the capital of the Peshwa, the untouchable was required to  carry,  strung  from  his  waist,  a  broom  to  sweep  away  from  behind  the dust  he  treaded  on  lest  a  Hindu  walking  on  the  same  should  be  polluted.

The  Balais  refused  to  comply ;  and  the  Hindu element proceeded against them. Balais were not allowed to get water from  the  village  wells;  they  were  not  allowed  to  let  go  their  cattle to  graze.  Balais  were  prohibited  from  passing  through  land  owned by  a  Hindu,  so  that  if  the  field  of  a  Balai  was  surrounded  by  fields owned  by  Hindus,  the  Balai  could  have  no  access  to  his  own  field. The Hindus also let their cattle graze down the fields of Balais. The Balais submitted petitions to the Darbar against these persecutions ; but as they could get no timely relief, and the oppression continued, hundreds  of  Balais  with  their  wives  and  children  were  obliged  to abandon  their  homes  in  which  their  ancestors  lived  for  generations and  to  migrate  to  adjoining  States,  viz.  to  villages  in  Dhar,  Dewas, Bagli, Bhopal, Gwalior and other States. What happened to them in their new homes may for the present be left out of our consideration. The  incident  at  Kavitha  in  Gujarat  happened  only  last  year.  The Hindus  of  Kavitha  ordered  the  untouchables  not  to  insist  upon sending  their  children  to  the  common  village  school  maintained  by Government.  What  sufferings  the  untouchables  of  Kavitha  had  to undergo  for  daring  to  exercise  a  civic  right  against  the  wishes  of the  Hindus  is  too  well  known  to  need  detailed  description.  Another instance  occurred  in  the  village  of  Zanu  in  the  Ahmedabad  district of Gujarat. In November 1935 some untouchable women of well-to-do families started fetching water in metal pots. The Hindus looked upon the  use  of  metal  pots  by  untouchables  as  an  affront  to  their  dignity and  assaulted  the  untouchable  women  for  their  impudence.  A  most recent  event  is  reported  from  the  village  Chakwara  in  Jaipur  State. It seems from the reports that have appeared in the newspapers that an untouchable of Chakwara who had returned from a pilgrimage had arranged  to  give  a  dinner  to  his  fellow  untouchables  of  the  village as  an  act  of  religious  piety.  The  host  desired  to  treat  the  guests  to a  sumptuous  meal  and  the  items  served  included  ghee  (butter)  also. But while the assembly of untouchables was engaged in partaking of the food, the Hindus in their hundreds, armed with lathis, rushed to the  scene,  despoiled  the  food  and  belaboured  the  untouchables  who"

But  no  one  would  think  that  consumption  of  ghee  was  a  mark  of high  social  status.  The  Hindus  of  Chakwara  thought  otherwise  and in  righteous  indignation  avenged  themselves  for  the  wrong  done  to them  by  the  untouchables,  who  insulted  them  by  treating  ghee  as an  item  of  their  food  which  they  ought  to  have  known  could  not  be theirs,  consistently  with  the  dignity  of  the  Hindus.  This  means  that an  untouchable  must  not  use  ghee  even  if  he  can  afford  to  buy  it, since  it  is  an  act  of  arrogance  towards  the  Hindus.

The view is current, and  it  is  pleasant  to  believe  in  it,  that  the  Communal  Award  is  unnatural and  that  it  is  the  result  of  an  unholy  alliance  between  the  minorities and  the  bureaucracy.  I  do  not  wish  to  rely  on  the  Communal  Award  as  a piece  of  evidence  to  support  my  contention  if  it  is  said  that  it  is  not  good evidence.  Let  us  turn  to  Ireland.  What  does  the  history  of  Irish  Home  Rule show ?  It  is  well-known  that  in  the  course  of  the  negotiations  between the  representatives  of  Ulster  and  Southern  Ireland,  Mr.  Redmond,  the representative    Ireland, in order to bring Ulster in a Home Rule Constitution"

Their  reply  was  \u201cDamn  your  safeguards, we  don\u2019t  want  to  be  ruled  by  you  on  any  terms.\u201d  People  who  blame  the minorities  in  India  ought  to  consider  what  would  have  happened  to  the political aspirations of the majority if the minorities had taken the attitude which.  Ulster  took.  Judged  by  the  attitude  of  Ulster  to  Irish  Home  Rule,  is it  nothing  that  the  minorities  agreed  to  be  ruled  by  the  majority  which  has not  shown  much  sense  of  statesmanship,  provided  some  safeguards  were devised for them ? But this is only incidental. The main question is why did Ulster  take  this  attitude?  The  only  answer  I  can  give  is  that  there  was  a social  problem  between  Ulster  and  Southern  Ireland  the  problem  between Catholics  and  Protestants,  essentially  a  problem  of  Caste.  That  Home  Rule in  Ireland  would  be  Rome  Rule  was  the  way  in  which  the  Ulstermen  had framed  their  answer.  But  that  is  only  another  way  of  stating  that  it  was the  social  problem  of  Caste  between  the  Catholics  and  Protestants,  which prevented  the  solution  of  the  political  problem.  This  evidence  again  is  sure to  be  challenged.  It  will  be  urged  that  here  too  the  hand  of  the  Imperialist was  at  work.  But  my  resources  are  not  exhausted.  I  will  give  evidence from  the  History  of  Rome.  Here  no  one  can  say  that  any  evil  genius  was at  work.  Any  one  who  has  studied  the  History  of  Rome  will  know  that  the Republican  Constitution  of  Rome  bore  marks  having  strong  resemblance  to the Communal Award. When the kingship in Rome was abolished, the Kingly power  or  the  Imperium  was  divided  between  the  Consuls  and  the  Pontifex Maximus.  In  the  Consuls  was  vested  the  secular  authority  of  the  King, while  the  latter  took  over  the  religious  authority  of  King.  This  Republican Constitution  had  provided  that,  of  the  two  Consuls  one  was  to  be  Patrician and the other Plebian. The same constitution had also provided that, of the Priests under the Pontifex Maximus, half were to be Plebians and the other half  Patricians.  Why  is  it  that  the  Republican  Constitution  of  Rome  had these provisions which, as I said, resemble so strongly the provisions of the Communal  Award ?  The  only  answer  one  can  get  is  that  the  Constitution of  Republican  Rome  had  to  take  account  of  the  social  division  between  the Patricians  and  the  Plebians,  who  formed  two  distinct  castes.  To  sum  up, let  political  reformers  turn  to  any  direction  they  like,  they  will  find  that  in the  making  of  a  constitution,  they  cannot  ignore  the  problem  arising  out  of the  prevailing  social  order."

Before the Arabs became a political power they had undergone a thorough religious revolution started by the Prophet Mohammad. Even Indian History supports the  same  conclusion.

The Socialists of India following their fellows in  Europe  are  seeking  to  apply  the  economic  interpretation  of  history  to the  facts  of  India.  They  propound  that  man  is  an  economic  creature,  that his  activities  and  aspirations  are  bound  by  economic  facts,  that  property  is the  only  source  of  power.  They,  therefore,  preach  that  political  and  social reforms are but gigantic illusions and that economic reform by equalization of property must have precedence over every other kind of reform. One may join issue on every one of these premises on which rests the Socialists\u2019 case for  economic  reform  having  priority  over  every  other  kind  of  reform.  One may  contend  that  economic  motive  is  not  the  only  motive  by  which  man is  actuated.  That  economic  power  is  the  only  kind  of  power  no  student  of human  society  can  accept.  That  the  social  status  of  an  individual  by  itself often  becomes  a  source  of  power  and  authority  is  made  clear  by  the  sway which the Mahatmas have held over the common man. Why do millionaires in  India  obey  penniless  Sadhus  and  Fakirs ?  Why  do  millions  of  paupers  in India  sell  their  trifling  trinckets  which  constitute  their  only  wealth  and  go to  Benares  and  Mecca ?  That,  religion  is  the  source  of  power  is  illustrated by the history of India where the priest holds a sway over the common man often  greater  than  the  magistrate  and  where  everything,  even  such  things as strikes and elections, so easily take a religious turn and can so easily be given  a  religious  twist.  Take  the  case  of  the  Plebians  of  Rome  as  a  further illustration  of  the  power  of  religion  over  man.  It  throws  great  light  on  this point.  The  Plebs  had  fought  for  a  share  in  the  supreme  executive  under the  Roman  Republic  and  had  secured  the  appointment  of  a  Plebian  Consul elected  by  a  separate  electorate  constituted  by  the  Commitia  Centuriata, which  was  an  assembly  of  Plebians.  They  wanted  a  Consul  of  their  own"

      "text": "because they felt that the Patrician Consuls used to discriminate against the Plebians in carrying on the administration. They had apparently obtained a great  gain  because  under  the  Republican  Constitution  of  Rome  one  Consul had  the  power  of  vetoing  an  act  of  the  other  Consul.  But  did  they  in  fact gain  anything ?  The  answer  to  this  question  must  be  in  the  negative.  The Plebians  never  could  get  a  Plebian  Consul  who  could  be  said  to  be  a  strong man and who could act independently of the Patrician Consul. In the ordinary course of things the Plebians should have got a strong Plebian Consul in view of  the  fact  that  his  election  was  to  be  by  a  separate  electorate  of  Plebians. The  question  is  why  did  they  fail  in  getting  a  strong  Plebian  to  officiate as  their  Consul ?  The  answer  to  this  question  reveals  the  dominion  which religion  exercises  over  the  minds  of  men.  It  was  an  accepted  creed  of  the whole Roman populus that no official could enter upon the duties of his office unless the Oracle of Delphi declared that he was acceptable to the Goddess. The priests who were in charge of the temple of the Goddess of Delphi were all  Patricians.  Whenever  therefore  the  Plebians  elected  a  Consul  who  was known to be a strong party man opposed to the Patricians or \u201ccommunal\u201d to use the term that is current in India, the Oracle invariably declared that he was  not  acceptable  to  the  Goddess.  This  is  how  the  Plebians  were  cheated out of their rights. But what is worthy of note is that the Plebians permitted themselves to be thus cheated because they too like the Patricians, held firmly the belief that the approval of the Goddess was a condition precedent to the taking  charge  by  an  official  of  his  duties  and  that  election  by  the  people was  not  enough.  If  the  Plebians  had  contended  that  election  was  enough and  that  the  approval  by  the  Goddess  was  not  necessary  they  would  have derived  the  fullest  benefit  from  the  political  right  which  they  had  obtained. But  they  did  not.  They  agreed  to  elect  another,  less  suitable  to  themselves but  more  suitable  to  the  Goddess  which  in  fact  meant  more  amenable  to the  Patricians.  Rather  than  give  up  religion,  the  Plebians  give  up  material gain for which they had fought so hard. Does this not show that religion can be  a  source  of  power  as  great  as  money  if  not  greater ?  The  fallacy  of  the Socialists  lies  in  supposing  that  because  in  the  present  stage  of  European Society property as a source of power is predominant, that the same is true of  India  or  that  the  same  was  true  of  Europe  in  the  past.  Religion,  social status  and  property  are  all  sources  of  power  and  authority,  which  one  man has,  to  control  the  liberty  of  another.  One  is  predominant  at  one  stage,  the other is predominant at another stage. That is the only difference. If liberty is the ideal, if liberty means the destruction of the dominion which one man holds  over  another  then  obviously  it  cannot  be  insisted  upon  that  economic reform  must  be  the  one  kind  of  reform  worthy  of  pursuit.  If  the  source  of power  and  dominion  is  at  any  given  time  or  in  any  given  society  social  and religious  then  social  reform  and  religious  reform  must  be  accepted  as  the necessary  sort  of  reform."

But I recognize that economic interpretation of  history  is  not  necessary  for  the  validity  of  the  Socialist  contention  that equalization  of  property  is  the  only  real  reform  and  that  it  must  precede everything  else.  However,  what  I  like  to  ask  the  Socialists  is  this :  Can  you have  economic  reform  without  first  bringing  about  a  reform  of  the  social order ? The Socialists of India do not seem to have considered this question. I do not wish to do them an injustice. I give below a quotation from a letter which  a  prominent  Socialist  wrote  a  few  days  ago  to  a  friend  of  mine  in which he said, \u201cI do not believe that we can build up a free society in India so long as there is a trace of this ill-treatment and suppression of one class by  another.  Believing  as  I  do  in  a  socialist  ideal,  inevitably  I  believe  in perfect equality in the treatment of various classes and groups. I think that Socialism  offers  the  only  true  remedy  for  this  as  well  as  other  problems.\u201d Now the question that I like to ask is : Is it enough for a Socialist to say, \u201cI believe  in  perfect  equality  in  the  treatment  of  the  various  classes ?\u201d  To  say that  such  a  belief  is  enough  is  to  disclose  a  complete  lack  of  understanding of  what  is  involved  in  Socialism.  If  Socialism  is  a  practical  programme  and is not merely an ideal, distant and far off, the question for a Socialist is not whether  he  believes  in  equality.  The  question  for  him  is  whether  he  minds one class ill-treating and suppressing another class as a matter of system, as a  matter  of  principle  and  thus  allow  tyranny  and  oppression  to  continue  to divide  one  class  from  another.  Let  me  analyse  the  factors  that  are  involved in  the  realization  of  Socialism  in  order  to  explain  fully  my  point.  Now  it  is obvious that the economic reform contemplated by the Socialists cannot come about  unless  there  is  a  revolution  resulting  in  the  seizure  of  power.  That seizure  of  power  must  be  by  a  proletariat.  The  first  question  I  ask  is :  Will the  proletariat  of  India  combine  to  bring  about  this  revolution ?  What  will move  men  to  such  an  action ?  It  seems  to  me  that  other  things  being  equal the  only  thing  that  will  move  one  man  to  take  such  an  action  is  the  feeling that  other  man  with  whom  he  is  acting  are  actuated  by  feeling  of  equality and  fraternity  and  above  all  of  justice.  Men  will  not  join  in  a  revolution  for the  equalization  of  property  unless  they  know  that  after  the  revolution  is achieved they will be treated equally and that there will be no discrimination of  caste  and  creed.  The  assurance  of  a  socialist  leading  the  revolution  that he  does  not  believe  in  caste,  I  am  sure,  will  not  suffice.  The  assurance must  be  the  assurance  proceeding  from  much  deeper  foundation,  namely, the  mental  attitude  of  the  compatriots  towards  one  another  in  their  spirit of  personal  equality  and  fraternity.  Can  it  be  said  that  the  proletariat  of India, poor as it is, recognise no distinctions except that of the rich and the poor ? Can it be said that the poor in India recognize no such distinctions of caste  or  creed,  high  or  low ?  If  the  fact  is  that  they  do,  what  unity  of  front can be expected from such a proletariat in its action against the rich ? How"

Suppose for the sake of argument that by some freak of fortune a revolution does take place and the Socialists come in power, will they not have to deal with the problems created by the particular social order prevalent in India ? I  can\u2019t  see  how  a  Socialist  State  in  India  can  function  for  a  second  without having  to  grapple  with  the  problems  created  by  the  prejudices  which  make Indian  people  observe  the  distinctions  of  high  and  low,  clean  and  unclean. If  Socialists  are  not  to  be  content  with  the  mouthing  of  fine  phrases,  if  the Socialists wish to make Socialism a definite reality then they must recognize that  the  problem  of  social  reform  is  fundamental  and  that  for  them  there is  no  escape  from  it.  That,  the  social  order  prevalent  in  India  is  a  matter which  a  Socialist  must  deal  with,  that  unless  he  does  so  he  cannot  achieve his  revolution  and  that  if  he  does  achieve  it  as  a  result  of  good  fortune  he will have to grapple with it if he wishes to realize his ideal, is a proposition which in my opinion is incontrovertible. He will be compelled to take account of  caste  after  revolution  if  he  does  not  take  account  of  it  before  revolution. This is only another way of saying that, turn in any direction you like, caste is the monster that crosses your path. You cannot have political reform, you cannot  have  economic  reform,  unless  you  kill  this  monster."

In  no  other  country  is  the  division  of  labour accompanied  by  this  gradation  of  labourers.  There  is  also  a  third  point  of criticism  against  this  view  of  the  Caste  System.  This  division  of  labour  is not  spontaneous,  it  is  not  based  on  natural  aptitudes.  Social  and  individual efficiency  requires  us  to  develop  the  capacity  of  an  individual  to  the  point of  competency  to  choose  and  to  make  his  own  career.  This  principle  is violated  in  the  Caste  System  in  so  far  as  it  involves  an  attempt  to  appoint tasks to individuals in advance, selected not on the basis of trained original capacities,  but  on  that  of  the  social  status  of  the  parents.  Looked  at  from another  point  of  view  this  stratification  of  occupations  which  is  the  result of  the  Caste  System  is  positively  pernicious.  Industry  is  never  static.

Now  the  Caste  System  will  not  allow  Hindus  to  take  to  occupations  where they  are  wanted  if  they  do  not  belong  to  them  by  heredity.  If  a  Hindu  is seen  to  starve  rather  than  take  to  new  occupations  not  assigned  to  his Caste,  the  reason  is  to  be  found  in  the  Caste  System.

The  division  of  labour brought  about  by  the  Caste  System  is  not  a  division  based  on  choice. Individual sentiment, individual preference has no place in it. It is based on the dogma of predestination. Considerations of social efficiency would compel us to recognize that the greatest evil in the industrial system is not so much poverty  and  the  suffering  that  it  involves  as  the  fact  that  so  many  persons have callings which make no appeal to those who are engaged in them. Such callings  constantly  provoke  one  to  aversion,  ill-will  and  the  desire  to  evade. There are many occupations in India which on account of the fact that they are  regarded  as  degraded  by  the  Hindus  provoke  those  who  are  engaged  in them to aversion. There is a constant desire to evade and escape from such occupations  which  arises  solely  because  of  the  blighting  effect  which  they produce  upon  those  who  follow  them  owing  to  the  slight  and  stigma  cast upon  them  by  the  Hindu  religion.

Caste system does not demarcate racial division. Caste system is a social division of people of the same race. Assuming it, however, to be a case of racial divisions one  may  ask :  What  harm  could  there  be  if  a  mixture  of  races  and  of  blood was  permitted  to  take  place  in  India  by  intermarriages  between  different Castes ?  Men  are  no  doubt  divided  from  animals  by  so  deep  a  distinction that  science  recognizes  men  and  animals  as  two  distinct  species.  But  even scientists who believe in purity of races do not assert that the different races constitute  different  species  of  men.  They  are  only  varieties  of  one  and  the same  species.  As  such  they  can  interbreed  and  produce  an  offspring  which is capable of breeding and which is not sterile. An immense lot of nonsense is  talked  about  heredity  and  eugenics  in  defence  of  the  Caste  System.  Few would object to the Caste System if it was in accord with the basic principle of eugenics because few can object to the improvement of the race by judicious mating. But one fails to understand how the Caste System secures judicious mating.  Caste  System  is  a  negative  thing.  It  merely  prohibits  persons belonging to different Castes from intermarrying. It is not a positive method of selecting which two among a given Caste should marry. If Caste is eugenic in origin then the origin of sub-Castes must also be eugenic. But can any one seriously maintain that the origin of sub-Castes is eugenic ? I think it would be  absurd  to  contend  for  such  a  proposition  and  for  a  very  obvious  reason. If Caste means race then differences of sub-Castes cannot mean differences of  race  because  sub-Castes  become  ex  hypothesia  sub-divisions  of  one  and the same race. Consequently the bar against intermarrying and interdining between sub-Castes cannot be for the purpose of maintaining purity of race or  of  blood.  If  sub-Castes  cannot  be  eugenic  in  origin  there  cannot  be  any substance  in  the  contention  that  Caste  is  eugenic  in  origin.  Again  if  Caste is  eugenic  in  origin  one  can  understand  the  bar  against  intermarriage.  But what  is  the  purpose  of  the  interdict  placed  on  interdining  between  Castes and  sub-Castes  alike ?  Interdining  cannot  infect  blood  and  therefore  cannot be  the  cause  either  of  the  improvement  or  of  deterioration  of  the  race.  This shows that Caste has no scientific origin and that those who are attempting to  give  it  an  eugenic  basis  are  trying  to  support  by  science  what  is  grossly unscientific. Even today eugenics cannot become a practical possibility unless we have definite knowledge regarding the laws of heredity. Prof. Batcson in his Mendel\u2019s Principles of Heredity says, \u201cThere is nothing in the descent of the higher mental qualities to suggest that they follow any single system of"

A  tree  should  be  judged  by  the  fruits  it  yields. If  caste  is  eugenic  what  sort  of  a  race  of  men  it  should  have  produced ? Physically speaking the Hindus are a C3 people.

It  was  given  by  the Mohammedans  to  the  natives  for  the  purpose  of  distinguishing  themselves. It  does  not  occur  in  any  Sanskrit  work  prior  to  the  Mohammedan  invasion. They  did  not  feel  the  necessity  of  a  common  name  because  they  had  no conception  of  their  having  constituted  a  community.  Hindu  society  as  such does not exist. It is only a collection of castes. Each caste is conscious of its existence. Its survival is the be all and end all of its existence. Castes do not even  form  a  federation.  A  caste  has  no  feeling  that  it  is  affiliated  to  other castes except when there is a Hindu-Muslim riot. On all other occasions each caste endeavours to segregate itself and to distinguish itself from other castes. Each  caste  not  only  dines  among  itself  and  marries  among  itself  but  each caste prescribes its own distinctive dress. What other explanation can there be  of  the  innumerable  styles  of  dress  worn  by  the  men  and  women  of  India which so amuse the tourists ? Indeed the ideal Hindu must be like a rat living in  his  own  hole  refusing  to  have  any  contact  with  others.  There  is  an  utter lack among the Hindus of what the sociologists call \u201cconsciousness of kind\u201d. There  is  no  Hindu  consciousness  of  kind.  In  every  Hindu  the  consciousness that  exists  is  the  consciousness  of  his  caste.  That  is  the  reason  why  the Hindus cannot be said to form a society or a nation. There are however many Indians  whose  patriotism  does  not  permit  them  to  admit  that  Indians  are not  a  nation,  that  they  are  only  an  amorphous  mass  of  people.

But  one  cannot  accept  the  conclusion  that  therefore,  the  Hindus  constitute a  society.  To  do  so  is  to  misunderstand  the  essentials  which  go  to  make  up a  society.  Men  do  not  become  a  society  by  living  in  physical  proximity  any more  than  a  man  ceases  to  be  a  member  of  his  society  by  living  so  many miles  away  from  other  men.  Secondly  similarity  in  habits  and  customs, beliefs  and  thoughts  is  not  enough  to  constitute  men  into  society.  Things may  be  passed  physically  from  one  to  another  like  bricks.  In  the  same  way habits  and  customs,  beliefs  and  thoughts  of  one  group  may  be  taken  over by  another  group  and  there  may  thus  appear  a  similarity  between  the  two. Culture  spreads  by  diffusion  and  that  is  why  one  finds  similarity  between various  primitive  tribes  in  the  matter  of  their  habits  and  customs,  beliefs and  thoughts,  although  they  do  not  live  in  proximity.  But  no  one  could  say that  because  there  was  this  similarity  the  primitive  tribes  constituted  one society. This is because similarly in certain things is not enough to constitute a  society.  Men  constitute  a  society  because  they  have  things  which  they possess in common. To have similar thing is totally different from possessing things  in  common.  And  the  only  way  by  which  men  can  come  to  possess things  in  common  with  one  another  is  by  being  in  communication  with  one another. This is merely another way of saying that Society continues to exist by  communication  indeed  in  communication.  To  make  it  concrete,  it  is  not enough  if  men  act  in  a  way  which  agrees  with  the  acts  of  others.  Parallel activity,  even  if  similar,  is  not  sufficient  to  bind  men  into  a  society.  This  is proved by the fact that the festivals observed by the different Castes amongst the Hindus are the same. Yet these parallel performances of similar festivals by  the  different  castes  have  not  bound  them  into  one  integral  whole.  For that  purpose  what  is  necessary  is  for  a  man  to  share  and  participate  in  a common activity so that the same emotions are aroused in him that animate the  others.  Making  the  individual  a  sharer  or  partner  in  the  associated activity  so  that  he  feels  its  success  as  his  success,  its  failure  as  his  failure is  the  real  thing  that  binds  men  and  makes  a  society  of  them.  The  Caste System  prevents  common  activity  and  by  preventing  common  activity  it has  prevented  the  Hindus  from  becoming  a  society  with  a  unified  life  and a  consciousness  of  its  own  being."

This  anti-social  spirit  is  not  confined  to  caste  alone.  It  has  gone deeper  and  has  poisoned  the  mutual  relations  of  the  sub-castes  as  well.  In my  province  the  Golak  Brahmins,  Deorukha  Brahmins,  Karada  Brahmins, Palshe  Brahmins  and  Chitpavan  Brahmins,  all  claim  to  be  sub-divisions  of the Brahmin Caste. But the anti-social spirit that prevails between them is quite  as  marked  and  quite  as  virulent  as  the  anti-social  spirit  that  prevails between  them  and  other  non-Brahmin  castes.  There  is  nothing  strange  in this.  An  anti-social  spirit  is  found  wherever  one  group  has  \u201cinterests  of  its own\u201d  which  shut  it  out  from  full  interaction  with  other  groups,  so  that  its prevailing  purpose  is  protection  of  what  it  has  got.  This  anti-social  spirit, this spirit of protecting its own interests is as much a marked feature of the different castes in their isolation from one another as it is of nations in their isolation. The Brahmin\u2019s primary concern is to protect \u201chis interest\u201d against those  of  the  non-Brahmins  and  the  non-Brahmin\u2019s  primary  concern  is  to protect their interests against those of the Brahmins. The Hindus, therefore, are not merely an assortment of castes but they are so many warring groups each  living  for  itself  and  for  its  selfish  ideal.  There  is  another  feature  of caste  which  is  deplorable.  The  ancestors  of  the  present-day  English  fought on one side or the other in the wars of the Roses and the Cromwellian War. But  the  decendents  of  those  who  fought  on  the  one  side  do  not  bear  any animosity\u2014any  grudge  against  the  descendents  of  those  who  fought  on  the other side. The feud is forgotten. But the present-day non-Brahmins cannot forgive the present-day Brahmins for the insult their ancestors gave to Shivaji. The  present-day  Kayasthas  will  not  forgive  the  present-day  Brahmins  for the  infamy  cast  upon  their  forefathers  by  the  forefathers  of  the  latter.  To what  is  this  difference  due ?  Obviously  to  the  Caste  System.  The  existence of  Caste  and  Caste  Consciousness  has  served  to  keep  the  memory  of  past feuds  between  castes  green  and  has  prevented  solidarity."

Why  has  no  attempt been  made  to  civilize  these  aborigines  and  to  lead  them  to  take  to  a  more honourable way of making a living ? The Hindus will probably seek to account for  this  savage  state  of  the  aborigines  by  attributing  to  them  congenital stupidity.  They  will  probably  not  admit  that  the  aborigines  have  remained savages  because  they  had  made  no  effort  to  civilize  them,  to  give  them medical  aid,  to  reform  them,  to  make  them  good  citizens.  But  supposing a  Hindu  wished  to  do  what  the  Christian  missionary  is  doing  for  these aborigines,  could  he  have  done  it ?  I  submit  not.  Civilizing  the  aborigines means  adopting  them  as  your  own,  living  in  their  midst,  and  cultivating fellow-feeling,  in  short  loving  them.  How  is  it  possible  for  a  Hindu  to  do this ?  His  whole  life  is  one  anxious  effort  to  preserve  his  caste.  Caste  is his  precious  possession  which  he  must  save  at  any  cost.  He  cannot  consent to  lose  it  by  establishing  contact  with  the  aborigines  the  remnants  of  the hateful  Anaryas  of  the  Vedic  days.  Not  that  a  Hindu  could  not  be  taught the  sense  of  duty  to  fallen  humanity,  but  the  trouble  is  that  no  amount  of sense  of  duty  can  enable  him  to  overcome  his  duty  to  preserve  his  caste. Caste  is,  therefore,  the  real  explanation  as  to  why  the  Hindu  has  let  the savage  remain  a  savage  in  the  midst  of  his  civilization  without  blushing or  without  feeling  any  sense  of  remorse  or  repentance.  The  Hindu  has  not realized  that  these  aborigines  are  a  source  of  potential  danger.  If  these savages  remain  savages  they  may  not  do  any  harm  to  the  Hindus.  But  if they  are  reclaimed  by  non-Hindus  and  converted  to  their  faiths  they  will swell  the  ranks  of  the  enemies  of  the  Hindus.  If  this  happens  the  Hindu will  have  to  thank  himself  and  his  Caste  System."

Inculcation of beliefs and dogmas is not the only problem that is involved in conversion. To find a place for the convert in the social life of the community is another and a much more important problem that arises in connection with conversion.

Unlike  the  club  the  membership  of  a  caste  is  not  open  to all  and  sundry.  The  law  of  caste  confines  its  membership  to  person  bom  in the  caste.

The idea underlying Sanghatan is to remove from the mind of the Hindu that timidity and cowardice which so  painfully  make  him  off  from  the  Mohammedan  and  the  Sikh  and  which have led him to adopt the low ways of treachery and cunning for protecting himself.  The  question  naturally  arises :  From  where  does  the  Sikh  or  the Mohammedan derive his strength which makes him brave and fearless ? I am sure it is not due to relative superiority of physical strength, diet or drill. It is due to the strength arising out of the feeling that all Sikhs will come to the rescue of a Sikh when he is in danger and that all Mohammedans will rush to  save  a  Muslim  if  he  is  attacked.  The  Hindu  can  derive  no  such  strength. He cannot feel assured that his fellows will come to his help. Being one and fated to be alone he remains powerless, develops timidity and cowardice and in  a  fight  surrenders  or  runs  away.  The  Sikh  as  well  as  the  Muslim  stands fearless  and  gives  battle  because  he  knows  that  though  one  he  will  not  be alone.  The  presence  of  this  belief  in  the  one  helps  him  to  hold  out  and  the absence of it in the other makes him to give way. If you pursue this matter further  and  ask  what  is  it  that  enables  the  Sikh  and  the  Mohammedan  to feel so assured and why is the Hindu filled with such despair in the matter of help and assistance you will find that the reasons for this difference lie in the difference in their associated mode of living. The associated mode of life practised  by  the  Sikhs  and  the  Mohammedans  produces  fellow-feeling.  The associated  mode  of  life  of  the  Hindus  does  not.  Among  Sikhs  and  Muslims there  is  a  social  cement  which  makes  them  Bhais.  Among  Hindus  there  is no such cement and one Hindu does not regard another Hindu as his Bhai. This  explains  why  a  Sikh  says  and  feels  that  one  Sikh,  or  one  Khalsa  is equal  to  Sava  Lakh  men.  This  explains  why  one  Mohammedan  is  equal  to a crowd of Hindus. This difference is undoubtedly a difference due to caste. So  long  as  caste  remains,  there  will  be  no  Sanghatan  and  so  long  as  there is  no  Sanghatan  the  Hindu  will  remain  weak  and  meek.  The  Hindus  claim to  be  a  very  tolerant  people.  In  my  opinion  this  is  a  mistake.  On  many occasions  they  can  be  intolerant  and  if  on  some  occasions  they  are  tolerant that  is  because  they  are  too  weak  to  oppose  or  too  indifferent  to  oppose. This  indifference  of  the  Hindus  has  become  so  much  a  part  of  their  nature that  a  Hindu  will  quite  meekly  tolerate  an  insult  as  well  as  a  wrong.  You see amongst them, to use the words of Morris, \u201cThe great reading down the little,  the  strong  heating  down  the  weak,  cruel  men  fearing  not,  kind  men daring  not  and  wise  men  caring  not.\u201d  With  the  Hindu  Gods  all  forbearing, it  is  not  difficult  to  imagine  the  pitiable  condition  of  the  wronged  and  the"

But  whether  the  reform will continue depends upon what scope the group affords for such individual assertion.  If  the  group  is  tolerant  and  fair-minded  in  dealing  with  such individuals they will continue to assert and in the end succeed in converting their  fellows.  On  the  other  hand  if  the  group  is  intolerant  and  does  not bother  about  the  means  it  adopts  to  stifle  such  individuals  they  will  perish and  the  reform  will  die  out.  New  a  caste  has  an  unquestioned  right  to excommunicate  any  man  who  is  guilty  of  breaking  the  rules  of  the  caste and  when  it  is  realized  that  excommunication  involves  a  complete  cesser of  social  intercourse  it  will  be  agreed  that  as  a  form  of  punishment  there is  really  little  to  choose  between  excommunication  and  death.  No  wonder individual  Hindus  have  not  had  the  courage  to  assert  their  independence by  breaking  the  barriers  of  caste.  It  is  true  that  man  cannot  get  on  with his  fellows.  But  it  is  also  true  that  he  cannot  do  without  them.  He  would like  to  have  the  society  of  his  fellows  on  his  terms.  If  he  cannot  get  it  on his  terms  then  he  will  be  ready  to  have  it  on  any  terms  even  amounting  to complete surrender. This is because he cannot do without society. A caste is ever  ready  to  take  advantage  of  the  helplessness  of  a  man  and  insist  upon complete  conformity  to  its  code  in  letter  and  in  spirit.  A  caste  can  easily organize  itself  into  a  conspiracy  to  make  the  life  of  a  reformer  a  hell  and  if a conspiracy is a crime I do not understand why such a nefarious act as an attempt  to  excommunicate  a  person  for  daring  to  act  contrary  to  the  rules of caste should not be made an offence punishable in law. But as it is, even law  gives  each  caste  an  autonomy  to  regulate  its  membership  and  punish dissenters  with  excommunication.  Caste  in  the  hands  of  the  orthodox  has been a powerful weapon for persecuting the reforms and for killing all reform."

There is  nothing  new  in  it.  I  will  therefore  turn  to  the  constructive  side  of  the problem.  What  is  your  ideal  society  if  you  do  not  want  caste  is  a  question that  is  bound  to  be  asked  of  you.  If  you  ask  me,  my  ideal  would  be  a society  based  on  Liberty,  Equality  and  Fraternity.  And  why  not ?  What objection can there be to Fraternity ? I cannot imagine any. An ideal society should be mobile, should be full of channels for conveying a change taking place  in  one  part  to  other  parts.  In  an  ideal  society  there  should  be  many interests  consciously  communicated  and  shared.  There  should  be  varied and  free  points  of  contact  with  other  modes  of  association.  In  other  words there  must  be  social  endosmosis.  This  is  fraternity,  which  is  only  another name  for  democracy.  Democracy  is  not  merely  a  form  of  Government. It  is  primarily  a  mode  of  associated  living,  of  conjoint  communicated experience.  It  is  essentially  an  attitude  of  respect  and  reverence  towards fellowmen.  Any  objection  to  Liberty ?  Few  object  to  liberty  in  the  sense  of a  right  to  free  movement,  in  the  sense  of  a  right  to  life  and  limb.  There is  no  objection  to  liberty  in  the  sense  of  a  right  to  property,  tools  and materials  as  being  necessary  for  earning  a  living  to  keep  the  body  in due  state  of  health.  Why  not  allow  liberty  to  benefit  by  an  effective  and competent  use  of  a  person\u2019s  powers ?  The  supporters  of  caste  who  would allow  liberty  in  the  sense  of  a  right  to  life,  limb  and  property,  would  not readily  consent  to  liberty  in  this  sense,  inasmuch  as  it  involves  liberty  to choose one\u2019s profession. But to object to this kind of liberty is to perpetuate slavery.  For  slavery  does  not  merely  mean  a  legalized  form  of  subjection. It  means  a  state  of  society  in  which  some  men  are  forced  to  accept  from other the purposes which control their conduct. This condition obtains even where  mere  is  no  slavery  in  the  legal  sense.  It  is  found  where,  as  in  the Caste  System,  some  persons  are  compelled  to  carry  on  certain  prescribed callings  which  are  not  of  their  choice.  Any  objection  to  equality ?  This has  obviously  been  the  most  contentious  part  of  the  slogan  of  the  French"

      "text": "Revolution.  The  objections  to  equality  may  be  sound  and  one  may  have to  admit  that  all  men  are  not  equal.  But  what  of  that ?  Equality  may  be a  fiction  but  nonetheless  one  must  accept  it  as  the  governing  principle.  A man\u2019s power is dependent upon (1) physical heredity, (2) social inheritance or  endowment  in  the  form  of  parental  care,  education,  accumulation  of scientific  knowledge,  everything  which  enables  him  to  be  more  efficient than  the  savage,  and  finally,  (3)  on  his  own  efforts.  In  all  these  three respects  men  are  undoubtedly  unequal.  But  the  question  is,  shall  we treat  them  as  unequal  because  they  are  unequal ?  This  is  a  question which  the  opponents  of  equality  must  answer.  From  the  standpoint  of  the individualist  it  may  be  just  to  treat  men  unequally  so  far  as  their  efforts are  unequal.  It  may  be  desirable  to  give  as  much  incentive  as  possible  to the full development of every one\u2019s powers. But what would happen if men were treated unequally as they are, in the first two respects ? It is obvious that those individuals also in whose favour there is birth, education, family name,  business  connections  and  inherited  wealth  would  be  selected  in  the race.  But  selection  under  such  circumstances  would  not  be  a  selection  of the  able.  It  would  be  the  selection  of  the  privileged.  The  reason  therefore, which  forces  that  in  the  third  respect  we  should  treat  men  unequally demands  that  in  the  first  two  respects  we  should  treat  men  as  equally  as possible. On the other hand it can be urged that if it is good for the social body  to  get  the  most  out  of  its  members,  it  can  get  most  out  of  them  only by  making  them  equal  as  far  as  possible  at  the  very  start  of  the  race. That  is  one  reason  why  we  cannot  escape  equality.  But  there  is  another reason  why  we  must  accept  equality.  A  Statesman  is  concerned  with  vast numbers of people. He has neither the time nor the knowledge to draw fine distinctions  and  to  treat  each  equitably  i.e.  according  to  need  or  according to  capacity.  However  desirable  or  reasonable  an  equitable  treatment  of men  may  be,  humanity  is  not  capable  of  assortment  and  classification. The statesman, therefore, must follow some rough and ready rule and that rough  and  ready  rule  is  to  treat  all  men  alike  not  because  they  are  alike but  because  classification  and  assortment  is  impossible.  The  doctrine  of equality  is  glaringly  fallacious  but  taking  all  in  all  it  is  the  only  way  a statesman  can  proceed  in  politics  which  is  a  severely  practical  affair  and which  demands  a  severely  practical  test."

In  the first  place,  if  under  the  Chaturvarnya  of  the  Arya  Samajists  an  individual is  to  take  his  place  in  the  Hindu  Society  according  to  his  worth.  I  do  not understand  why  the  Arya  Samajists  insist  upon  labelling  men  as  Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra. A learned man would be honoured without his  being  labelled  a  Brahmin.  A  soldier  would  be  respected  without  his being  designated  a  Kshatriya.  If  European  society  honours  its  soldiers  and its  servants  without  giving  them  permanent  labels,  why  should  Hindu Society  find  it  difficult  to  do  so  is  a  question,  which  Arya  Samajists  have not cared to consider. There is another objection to the continuance of these labels. All reform consists in a change in the notions, sentiment and mental attitudes  of  the  people  towards  men  and  things.  It  is  common  experience that  certain  names  become  associated  with  certain  notions  and  sentiments, which  determine  a  person\u2019s  attitude  towards  men  and  things.  The  names, Brahmin,  Kshatriya,  Vaishya  and  Shudra,  are  names  which  are  associated with  a  definite  and  fixed  notion  in  the  mind  of  every  Hindu.  That  notion  is that of a hierarchy based on birth. So long as these names continue, Hindus will  continue  to  think  of  the  Brahmin,  Kshatriya,  Vaishya  and  Shudra  as hierarchical  divisions  of  high  and  low,  based  on  birth,  and  act  accordingly. The  Hindu  must  be  made  to  unlearn  all  this.  But  how  can  this  happen  if the  old  labels  remain  and  continue  to  recall  to  his  mind  old  notions.  If  new notions  are  to  be  inculcated  in  the  minds  of  people  it  is  necessary  to  give them new names. To continue the old name is to make the reform futile. To allow  this  Chaturvarnya,  based  on  worth  to  be  designated  by  such  stinking labels of Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, indicative of social divisions based  on  birth,  is  a  snare."

In  this  respect,  the  ideal  of  Chaturvarnya  has, as  you  will  see,  a  close  affinity  to  the  Platonic  ideal.  To  Plato,  men  fell  by nature  into  three  classes.  In  some  individuals,  he  believed  mere  appetites dominated. He assigned them to the labouring and trading classes. Others revealed  to  him  that  over  and  above  appetites,  they  have  a  courageous disposition. He classed them as defenders in war and guardians of internal peace.  Others  showed  a  capacity  to  grasp  the  universal  reason  underlying things. He made them the law-givers of the people. The criticism to which Plato\u2019s  Republic  is  subject,  is  also  the  criticism  which  must  apply  to  the system  of  Chaturvarnya,  in  so  far  as  it  proceeds  upon  the  possibility of  an  accurate  classification  of  men  into  four  distinct  classes.  The  chief criticism  against  Plato  is  that  his  idea  of  lumping  of  individuals  into  a few  sharply  marked-off  classes  is  a  very  superficial  view  of  man  and  his powers.  Plato  had  no  perception  of  the  uniqueness  of  every  individual,  of his  incommensurability  with  others,  of  each  individual  forming  a  class  of his own. He had no recognition of the infinite diversity of active tendencies and  combination  of  tendencies  of  which  an  individual  is  capable.  To  him, there were types of faculties or powers in the individual constitution. All this is  demonstrably  wrong.  Modern  science  has  shown  that  lumping  together of  individuals  into  a  few  sharply  marked-off  classes  is  a  superficial  view of  man  not  worthy  of  serious  consideration.  Consequently,  the  utilization of  the  qualities  of  individuals  is  incompitable  with  their  startification  by classes,  since  the  qualities  of  individuals  are  so  variable.  Chaturvarnya must  fail  for  the  very  reason  for  which  Plato\u2019s  Republic  must  fail,  namely that it is not possible to pigeon men into holes, according as he belongs to one  class  or  the  other.  That  it  is  impossible  to  accurately  classify  people into four definite classes is proved by the fact that the original four classes have  now  become  four  thousand  castes."

Some people seem to blame Rama because he want only and without reason killed Shambuka.  But  to  blame  Rama  for  killing  Shambuka  is  to  misunderstand the whole situation. Ram Raj was a Raj based on Chaturvarnya. As a king, Rama was bound to maintain Chaturvarnya. It was his duty therefore to kill Shambuka, the Shudra, who had transgressed his class and wanted to be a Brahmin. This is the reason why Rama killed Shambuka. But this also shows that  penal  sanction  is  necessary  for  the  maintenance  of  Chaturvarnya.  Not only  penal  sanction  is  necessary,  but  penalty  of  death  is  necessary.  That  is why  Rama  did  not  inflict  on  Shambuka  a  lesser  punishment.  That  is  why Manu-Smriti  prescribes  such  heavy  sentences  as  cutting  off  the  tongue  or pouring  of  molten  lead  in  the  ears  of  the  Shudra,  who  recites  or  hears  the Veda.

      "text": "why  should  the  Shudra  need  trouble  to  acquire  wealth,  when  the  three Varnas  are  there  to  support  him ?  Why  need  the  Shudra  bother  to  take  to education, when there is the Brahmin to whom he can go when the occasion for  reading  or  writing  arises ?  Why  need  the  Shudra  worry  to  arm  himself because there is the Kshatriya to protect him ? The theory of Chaturvarnya, understood  in  this  sense,  may  be  said  to  look  upon  the  Shudra  as  the  ward and  the  three  Varnas  as  his  guardians.  Thus  interpreted,  it  is  a  simple, elevating  and  alluring  theory.  Assuming  this  to  be  the  correct  view  of  the underlying  conception  of  Chaturvarnya,  it  seems  to  me  that  the  system is  neither  fool-proof  nor  knave-proof.  What  is  to  happen,  if  the  Brahmins, Vaishyas  and  Kshatriyas  fail  to  pursue  knowledge,  to  engage  in  economic enterprise  and  to  be  efficient  soldiers  which  are  their  respective  functions ? Contrary-wise,  suppose  that  they  discharge  their  functions  but  flout  their duty  to  the  Shudra  or  to  one  another,  what  is  to  happen  to  the  Shudra  if the three classes refuse to support him on fair terms or combine to keep him down ? Who is to safeguard the interests of the Shudra or for the matter of that  of  the  Vaishya  and  Kshatriya  when  the  person,  who  is  trying  to  take advantage  of  his  ignorance  is  the  Brahmin ?  Who  is  to  defend  the  liberty of  the  Shudra  and  for  the  matter  of  that,  of  the  Brahmin  and  the  Vaishya when the person who is robbing him of it is the Kshatriya ? Inter-dependence of  one  class  on  another  class  is  inevitable.  Even  dependence  of  one  class upon  another  may  sometimes  become  allowable.  But  why  make  one  person depend  upon  another  in  the  matter  of  his  vital  needs ?  Education  everyone must have. Means of defence everyone must have. These are the paramount requirements  of  every  man  for  his  self-preservation.  How  can  the  fact  that his  neighbour  is  educated  and  armed  help  a  man  who  is  uneducated  and disarmed.  The  whole  theory  is  absurd.  These  are  the  questions,  which  the defenders  of  Chaturvarnya  do  not  seem  to  be  troubled  about.  But  they  are very  pertinent  questions.  Assuming  their  conception  of  Chaturvarnya  that the  relationship  between  the  different  classes  is  that  of  ward  and  guardian is the real conception underlying Chaturvarnya, it must be admitted that it makes no provision to safeguard the interests of the ward from the misdeeds of  the  guardian.  Whether  the  relationship  of  guardian  and  ward  was  the real  underlying  conception,  on  which  Chaturvarnya  was  based,  there  is  no doubt  that  in  practice  the  relation  was  that  of  master  and  servants.  The three  classes,  Brahmins,  Kshatriyas  and  Vaishyas  although  not  very  happy in their mutual relationship managed to work by compromise. The Brahmin flattered  the  Kshatriya  and  both  let  the  Vaishya  live  in  order  to  be  able  to live  upon  him.  But  the  three  agreed  to  beat  down  the  Shudra.  He  was  not allowed to acquire wealth lest he should be independent of the three Varnas. He  was  prohibited  from  acquiring  knowledge  lest  he  should  keep  a  steady vigil  regarding  his  interests.  He  was  prohibited  from  bearing  arms  lest  he should  have  the  means  to  rebel  against  their  authority.  That  this  is  how the  Shudras  were  treated  by  the  Tryavarnikas  is  evidenced  by  the  Laws"

Any  instance  from  anywhere  of  social  injustice must pale before it. Why have the mass of people tolerated the social evils to  which  they  have  been  subjected ?  There  have  been  social  revolutions  in other  countries  of  the  world.  Why  have  there  not  been  social  revolutions in  India,  is  a  question  which  has  incessantly  troubled  me.  There  is  only one  answer,  which  I  can  give  and  it  is  that  the  lower  classes  of  Hindus have been completely disabled for direct action on account of this wretched system  of  Chaturvarnya.  They  could  not  bear  arms  and  without  arms they  could  not  rebel.  They  were  all  ploughmen  or  rather  condemned  to  be ploughmen  and  they  never  were  allowed  to  convert  their  ploughshare  into swords. They had no bayonets and therefore everyone who chose could and did  sit  upon  them.  On  account  of  the  Chaturvarnya,  they  could  receive  no education.  They  could  not  think  out  or  know  the  way  to  their  salvation. They  were  condemned  to  be  lowly  and  not  knowing  the  way  of  escape and  not  having  the  means  of  escape,  they  became  reconciled  to  eternal servitude,  which  they  accepted  as  their  inescapable  fate.  It  is  true  that even  in  Europe  the  strong  has  not  shrunk  from  the  exploitation,  nay  the spoliation  of  the  weak.  But  in  Europe,  the  strong  have  never  contrived  to make  the  weak  helpless  against  exploitation  so  shamelessly  as  was  the case  in  India  among  the  Hindus.  Social  war  has  been  raging  between  the strong and the weak far more violently in Europe than it has ever been in India.  Yet,  the  weak  in  Europe  has  had  in  his  freedom  of  military  service his physical weapon, in suffering his political weapon and in education his moral weapon. These three weapons for emancipation were never withheld by  the  strong  from  the  weak  in  Europe.  All  these  weapons  were,  however, denied  to  the  masses  in  India  by  Chaturvarnya.  There  cannot  be  a  more degrading  system  of  social  organization  than  the  Chaturvarnya.  It  is  the system  which  deadens,  paralyses  and  cripples  the  people  from  helpful activity.  This  is  no  exaggeration.  History  bears  ample  evidence.  There  is only  one  period  in  Indian  history  which  is  a  period  of  freedom,  greatness and glory. That is the period of the Mourya Empire. At all other times the country  suffered  from  defeat  and  darkness.  But  the  Mourya  period  was  a period when Chaturvarnya was completely annihilated, when the Shudras, who  constituted  the  mass  of  the  people,  came  into  their  own  and  became the  rulers  of  the  country.  The  period  of  defeat  and  darkness  is  the  period when Chaturvarnya flourished to the damnation of the greater part of the people  of  the  country."

The  Bhagwat  tells  us  very  definitely  that  Krishna  had  taken Avtar  for  one  sacred  purpose  and  that  was  to  annihilate  the  Kshatriyas.

I  was  hesitating  whether  I  should  deal  with  their  point of  view.  But  on  further  consideration  I  have  come  to  the  conclusion  that I  must  and  that  for  two  reasons.  Firstly,  their  attitude  to  the  problem  of caste  is  not  merely  an  attitude  of  neutrality,  but  is  an  attitude  of  armed neutrality. Secondly, they probably represent a considerable body of people. Of  these,  there  is  one  set  which  finds  nothing  peculiar  nor  odious  in  the Caste  System  of  the  Hindus.  Such  Hindus  cite  the  case  of  Muslims,  Sikhs and  Christians  and  find  comfort  in  the  fact  that  they  too  have  castes amongst  them.  In  considering,  this  question  you  must  at  the  outset  bear in  mind  that  nowhere  is  human  society  one  single  whole.  It  is  always plural.  In  the  world  of  action,  the  individual  is  one  limit  and  society  the other.  Between  them  lie  all  sorts  of  associative  arrangements  of  lesser and  larger  scope,  families,  friendship,  co-operative  associations,  business combines,  political  parties,  bands  of  thieves  and  robbers.  These  small groups  are  usually  firmly  welded  together  and  are  often  as  exclusive  as castes.  They  have  a  narrow  and  intensive  code,  which  is  often  anti-social. This  is  true  of  every  society,  in  Europe  as  well  as  in  Asia.  The  question to  be  asked  in  determining  whether  a  given  society  is  an  ideal  society;  is not  whether  there  are  groups  in  it,  because  groups  exist  in  all  societies. The  questions  to  be  asked  in  determining  what  is  an  ideal  society  are : How  numerous  and  varied  are  the  interests  which  are  consciously  shared by  the  groups ?  How  full  and  free  is  the  interplay  with  other  forms  of associations ? Are the forces that separate groups and classes more numerous than  the  forces  that  unite ?  What  social  significance  is  attached  to  this group  life ?  Is  its  exclusiveness  a  matter  of  custom  and  convenience  or  is it  a  matter  of  religion ?

      "text": "decide whether caste among Non-Hindus is the same as caste among Hindus. If we apply these considerations to castes among Mohammedans, Sikhs and Christians  on  the  one  hand  and  to  castes  among  Hindus  on  the  other,  you will find that caste among Non-Hindus is fundamentally different from caste among  Hindus.  First,  the  ties,  which  consciously  make  the  Hindus  hold together,  are  non-existent,  while  among  Non-Hindus  there  are  many  that hold  them  together.  The  strength  of  a  society  depends  upon  the  presence  of points of contact, possibilities of interaction between different groups which exist  in  it.  These  are  what  Carlyle  calls  \u201corganic  filaments\u201d  i.e.  the  elastic threads  which  help  to  bring  the  disintegrating  elements  together  and  to reunite them. There is no integrating force among the Hindus to counteract the  disintegration  caused  by  caste.  While  among  the  Non-Hindus  there are  plenty  of  these  organic  filaments  which  bind  them  together.  Again  it must  be  borne  in  mind  that  although  there  are  castes  among  Non-Hindus, as  there  are  among  Hindus,  caste  has  not  the  same  social  significance  for Non-Hindus  as  it  has  for  Hindus.  Ask  Mohammedan  or  a  Sikh,  who  he  is ? He  tells  you  that  he  is  a  Mohammedan  or  a  Sikh  as  the  case  may  be.  He does  not  tell  you  his  caste  although  he  has  one  and  you  are  satisfied  with his  answer.  When  he  tells  you  that  he  is  a  Muslim,  you  do  not  proceed  to ask  him  whether  he  is  a  Shiya  or  a  Sunni;  Sheikh  or  Saiyad;  Khatik  or Pinjari.  When  he  tells  you  he  is  a  Sikh,  you  do  not  ask  him  whether  he  is Jat  or  Roda;  Mazbi  or  Ramdasi.  But  you  are  not  satisfied,  if  a  person  tells you  that  he  is  a  Hindu.  You  feel  bound  to  inquire  into  his  caste.  Why ? Because  so  essential  is  caste  in  the  case  of  a  Hindu  that  without  knowing it  you  do  not  feel  sure  what  sort  of  a  being  he  is.  That  caste  has  not  the same social significance among Non-Hindus as it has among Hindus is clear if you take into consideration the consequences which follow breach of caste. There may be castes among Sikhs and Mohammedans but the Sikhs and the Mohammedans  will  not  outcast  a  Sikh  or  a  Mohammedan  if  he  broke  his caste.  Indeed,  the  very  idea  of  excommunication  is  foreign  to  the  Sikhs  and the  Mohammedans.  But  with  the  Hindus  the  case  is  entirely  different.  He is  sure  to  be  outcasted  if  he  broke  caste.  This  shows  the  difference  in  the social  significance  of  caste  to  Hindus  and  Non-Hindus.  This  is  the  second point of difference. But there is also a third and a more important one. Caste among the non-Hindus has no religious consecration ; but among the Hindus most decidedly it has. Among the Non-Hindus, caste is only a practice, not a sacred institution. They, did not originate it. With them it is only a survival. They do not regard caste as a religious dogma. Religion compels the Hindus to  treat  isolation  and  segregation  of  castes  as  a  virtue.  Religion  does  not compel  the  Non-Hindus  to  take  the  same  attitude  towards  caste.  If  Hindus wish to break caste, their religion will come in their way. But it will not be so  in  the  case  of  Non-Hindus.  It  is,  therefore,  a  dangerous  delusion  to  take comfort  in  the  mere  existence  of  caste  among  Non-Hindus,  without  caring to  know  what  place  caste  occupies  in  their  life  and  whether  there  are  other"

Such  Hindus  seek  comfort  in  the  view  that  the  Hindus  have survived  and  take  this  as  a  proof  of  their  fitness  to  survive.  This  point  of view  is  well  expressed  by  Prof.  S.  Radhakrishnan  in  his  Hindu  view  of Life.  Referring  to  Hinduism  he  says,  \u201cThe  civilization  itself  has  not  been  a shortlived  one.  Its  historic  records  date  back  for  over  four  thousand  years and  even  then  it  had  reached  a  stage  of  civilization  which  has  continued its unbroken, though at times slow and static, course until the present day. It  has  stood  the  stress  and  strain  of  more  than  four  or  five  millenniums of  spiritual  thought  and  experience.  Though  peoples  of  different  races  and cultures  have  been  pouring  into  India  from  the  dawn  of  History,  Hinduism has  been  able  to  maintain  its  supremacy  and  even  the  proselytising  creeds backed  by  political  power  have  not  been  able  to  coerce  the  large  majority of  Hindus  to  their  views.  The  Hindu  culture  possesses  some  vitality  which seems  to  be  denied  to  some  other  more  forceful  currents.  It  is  no  more necessary  to  dissect  Hinduism  than  to  open  a  tree  to  see  whether  the  sap still  runs.\u201d  The  name  of  Prof.  Radhakrishnan  is  big  enough  to  invest  with profundity  whatever  he  says  and  impress  the  minds  of  his  readers.  But  I must  not  hesitate  to  speak  out  my  mind.  For,  I  fear  that,  his  statement may  become  the  basis  of  a  vicious  argument  that  the  fact  of  survival  is proof  of  fitness  to  survive.  It  seems  to  me  that  the  question  is  not  whether a community lives or dies ; the question is on what plane does it live. There are  different  modes  of  survival.  But  all  are  not  equally  honourable.  For  an individual  as  well  as  for  a  society,  there  is  a  gulf  between  merely  living and living worthily. To fight in a battle and to live in glory is one mode. To beat  a  retreat,  to  surrender  and  to  live  the  life  of  a  captive  is  also  a  mode of survival. It is useless for a Hindu to take comfort in the fact that he and his  people  have  survived.  What  he  must  consider  is  what  is  the  quality  of their  survival.  If  he  does  that,  I  am  sure  he  will  cease  to  take  pride  in  the mere  fact  of  survival.  A  Hindu\u2019s  life  has  been  a  life  of  continuous  defeat and  what  appears  to  him  to  be  life  everlasting  is  not  living  everlastingly but  is  really  a  life  which  is  perishing  everlastingly.  It  is  a  mode  of  survival of  which  every  right-minded  Hindu,  who  is  not  afraid  to  own  up  the  truth, will  feel  ashamed."

      "text": "The  only  question  that  remains  to  be  considered  is\u2014How  to  bring  about the  reform  of  the  Hindu  social  order ?  How  to  abolish  caste ?  This  is  a question  of  supreme  importance.  There  is  a  view  that  in  the  reform  of caste,  the  first  step  to  take,  is  to  abolish  sub-castes.  This  view  is  based upon  the  supposition  that  there  is  a  greater  similarity  in  manners  and status  between  sub-castes  than  there  is  between  castes.  I  think,  this  is  an erroneous  supposition.  The  Brahmins  of  Northern  and  Central  India  are socially  of  lower  grade,  as  compared  with  the  Brahmins  of  the  Deccan  and Southern  India.  The  former  are  only  cooks  and  water-carriers  while  the latter  occupy  a  high  social  position.  On  the  other  hand,  in  Northern  India, the Vaishyas and Kayasthas are intellectually and socially on a par with the Brahmins  of  the  Deccan  and  Southern  India.  Again,  in  the  matter  of  food there  is  no  similarity  between  the  Brahmins  of  the  Deccan  and  Southern India,  who  are  vegetarians  and  the  Brahmins  of  Kashmir  and  Bengal  who are  non-vegetarians.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Brahmins  of  the  Deccan  and Southern  India  have  more  in  common  so  far  as  food  is  concerned  with  such non-Brahmins  as  the  Gujaratis,  Marwaris,  Banias  and  Jains.  There  is  no doubt  that  from  the  standpoint  of  making  the  transit  from  one  caste  to another  easy,  the  fusion  of  the  Kayasthas  of  Northern  India  and  the  other Non-Brahmins of Southern India with the Non-Brahmins of the Deccan and the  Dravid  country  is  more  practicable  than  the  fusion  of  the  Brahmins  of the  South  with  the  Brahmins  of  the  North.  But  assuming  that  the  fusion of  sub-Castes  is  possible,  what  guarantee  is  there  that  the  abolition  of  sub- Castes  will  necessarily  lead  to  the  abolition  of  Castes ?  On  the  contrary, it  may  happen  that  the  process  may  stop  with  the  abolition  of  sub-Castes. In  that  case,  the  abolition  of  sub-Castes  will  only  help  to  strengthen  the Castes  and  make  them  more  powerful  and  therefore  more  mischievous. This  remedy  is  therefore  neither  practicable  nor  effective  and  may  easily prove  to  be  a  wrong  remedy.  Another  plan  of  action  for  the  abolition  of Caste  is  to  begin  with  inter-caste  dinners.  This  also,  in  my  opinion,  is  an inadequate  remedy.  There  are  many  Castes  which  allow  inter-dining.  But it  is  a  common  experience  that  inter-dining  has  not  succeeded  in  killing the  spirit  of  Caste  and  the  consciousness  of  Caste.  I  am  convinced  that  the real  remedy  is  inter-marriage.  Fusion  of  blood  can  alone  create  the  feeling of  being  kith  and  kin  and  unless  this  feeling  of  kinship,  of  being  kindred, becomes  paramount  the  separatist  feeling\u2014the  feeling  of  being  aliens\u2014 created  by  Caste  will  not  vanish.  Among  the  Hindus  inter-marriage  must necessarily  be  a  factor  of  greater  force  in  social  life  than  it  need  be  in  the life  of  the  non-Hindus.  Where  society  is  already  well-knit  by  other  ties, marriage  is  an  ordinary  incident  of  life.  But  where  society  cut  asunder, marriage  as  a  binding  force  becomes  a  matter  of  urgent  necessity.  The  real remedy  for  breaking  Caste  is  inter-marriage.  Nothing  else  will  serve  as  the solvent of Caste. Your Jat-Pat-Todak Mandal has adopted this line of attack"

      "text": "It  is  a  direct,  and  frontal  attack,  and  I  congratulate  you  upon  a  correct diagnosis and more upon your having shown the courage to tell the Hindus what  is  really  wrong  with  them.  Political  tyranny  is  nothing  compared  to social tyranny and a reformer, who defies society, is a much more courageous man  than  a  politician,  who  defies  Government.  You  are  right  in  holding that  Caste  will  cease  to  be  an  operative  force  only  when  inter-dining  and inter-marriage  have  become  matters  of  common  course.  You  have  located the  source  of  the  disease.  But  is  your  prescription  the  right  prescription  for the  disease ?  Ask  yourselves  this  question;  Why  is  it  that  a  large  majority of  Hindus  do  not  inter-dine  and  do  not  inter-marry?  Why  is  it  that  your cause  is  not  popular ?  There  can  be  only  one  answer  to  this  question  and it  is  that  inter-dining  and  inter-marriage  are  repugnant  to  the  beliefs  and dogmas  which  the  Hindus  regard  as  sacred.  Caste  is  not  a  physical  object like a wall of bricks or a line of barbed wire which prevents the Hindus from co-mingling  and  which  has,  therefore,  to  be  pulled  down.  Caste  is  a  notion, it  is  a  state  of  the  mind.  The  destruction  of  Caste  does  not  therefore  mean the destruction of a physical barrier. It means a notional change. Caste may be bad. Caste may lead to conduct so gross as to be called man\u2019s inhumanity to  man.  All  the  same,  it  must  be  recognized  that  the  Hindus  observe  Caste not because they are inhuman or wrong headed. They observe Caste because they  are  deeply  religious.  People  are  not  wrong  in  observing  Caste.  In  my view,  what  is  wrong  is  their  religion,  which  has  inculcated  this  notion  of Caste.  If  this  is  correct,  then  obviously  the  enemy,  you  must  grapple  with, is  not  the  people  who  observe  Caste,  but  the  Shastras  which  teach  them this  religion  of  Caste.  Criticising  and  ridiculing  people  for  not  inter-dining or inter-marrying or occasionally holding inter-caste dinners and celebrating inter-caste  marriages,  is  a  futile  method  of  achieving  the  desired  end.  The real  remedy  is  to  destroy  the  belief  in  the  sanctity  of  the  Shastras.  How do  you  expect  to  succeed,  if  you  allow  the  Shastras  to  continue  to  mould the  beliefs  and  opinions  of  the  people ?  Not  to  question  the  authority  of  the Shastras, to permit the people to believe in their sanctity and their sanctions and  to  blame  them  and  to  criticise  them  for  their  acts  as  being  irrational and  inhuman  is  a  incongruous  way  of  carrying  on  social  reform.  Reformers working  for  the  removal  of  untouchability  including  Mahatma  Gandhi,  do not  seem  to  realize  that  the  acts  of  the  people  are  merely  the  results  of their  beliefs  inculcated  upon  their  minds  by  the  Shastras  and  that  people will  not  change  their  conduct  until  they  cease  to  believe  in  the  sanctity  of the Shastras on which their conduct is founded. No wonder that such efforts have not produced any results. You also seem to be erring in the same way as the reformers working in the cause of removing untouchability. To agitate for and to organise inter-caste dinners and inter-caste marriages is like forced feeding brought about by artificial means. Make every man and woman free from  the  thraldom  of  the  Shastras,  cleanse  their  minds  of  the  pernicious"

      "text": "What are your chances of success ? Social reforms fall into different species. There is a species of reform, which does not relate to the religious notion of people  but  is  purely  secular  in  character.  There  is  also  a  species  of  reform, which relates to the religious notions of people. Of such a species of reform, there are two varieties. In one, the reform accords with the principles of the religion  and  merely  invites  people,  who  have  departed  from  it,  to  revert  to them  and  to  follow  them.  The  second  is  a  reform  which  not  only  touches the  religious  principles  but  is  diametrically  opposed  to  those  principles and  invites  people  to  depart  from  and  to  discard  their  authority  and  to act  contrary  to  those  principles.  Caste  is  the  natural  outcome  of  certain religious beliefs which have the sanction of the Shastras, which are believed to contain the command of divinely inspired sages who were endowed with a supernatural  wisdom  and  whose  commands,  therefore,  cannot  be  disobeyed without  committing  sin.  The  destruction  of  Caste  is  a  reform  which  falls under  the  third  category.  To  ask  people  to  give  up  Caste  is  to  ask  them  to go  contrary  to  their  fundamental  religious  notions.  It  is  obvious  that  the first  and  second  species  of  reform  are  easy.  But  the  third  is  a  stupendous task,  well-nigh  impossible.  The  Hindus  hold  to  the  sacredness  of  the  social order.  Caste  has  a  divine  basis.  You  must  therefore  destroy  the  sacredness and  divinity  with  which  Caste  has  become  invested.  In  the  last  analysis, this  means  you  must  destroy  the  authority  of  the  Shastras  and  the  Vedas."

      "text": "One  of  these  reasons  is  the  attitude  of  hostility,  which  the  Brahmins  have shown  towards  this  question.  The  Brahmins  form  the  vanguard  of  the movement  for  political  reform  and  in  some  cases  also  of  economic  reform. But  they  are  not  to  be  found  even  as  camp-followers  in  the  army  raised to  break  down  the  barricades  of  Caste.  Is  there  any  hope  of  the  Brahmins ever  taking  up  a  lead  in  the  future  in  this  matter ?  I  say  no.  You  may  ask why ? You may argue that there is no reason why Brahmins should continue to  shun  social  reform.  You  may  argue  that  the  Brahmins  know  that  the bane  of  Hindu  Society  is  Caste  and  as  an  enlightened  class  could  not  be expected  to  be  indifferent  to  its  consequences.  You  may  argue  that  there are  secular  Brahmins  and  priestly  Brahmins  and  if  the  latter  do  not  take up the cudgels on behalf of those who want to break Caste, the former will. All  this  of  course  sounds  very  plausible.  But  in  all  this  it  is  forgotten  that the  break  up  of  the  Caste  system  is  bound  to  affect  adversely  the  Brahmin Caste.  Having  regard  to  this,  is  it  reasonable  to  expect  that  the  Brahmins will  ever  consent  to  lead  a  movement  the  ultimate  result  of  which  is  to destroy  the  power  and  prestige  of  the  Brahmin  Caste ?  Is  it  reasonable  to expect  the  secular  Brahmins  to  take  part  in  a  movement  directed  against the  priestly  Brahmins ?  In  my  judgment,  it  is  useless  to  make  a  distinction between  the  secular  Brahmins  and  priestly  Brahmins.  Both  are  kith  and kin.  They  are  two  arms  of  the  same  body  and  one  bound  to  fight  for  the existence of the other. In this connection, I am reminded of some very pregnant remarks  made  by  Prof.  Dicey  in  his  English  Constitution.  Speaking  of  the actual  limitation  on  the  legislative  supremacy  of  Parliament,  Dicey  says : \u201cThe  actual  exercise  of  authority  by  any  sovereign  whatever,  and  notably by Parliament, is bounded or controlled by two limitations. Of these the one is  an  external,  and  the  other  is  an  internal  limitation.  The  external  limit to  the  real  power  of  a  sovereign  consists  in  the  possibility  or  certainty  that his  subjects  or  a  large  number  of  them  will  disobey  or  resist  his  laws.  .  . The  internal  limit  to  the  exercise  of  sovereignty  arises  from  the  nature  of the sovereign power itself. Even a despot exercises his powers in accordance with his character, which is itself moulded by the circumstance under which he  lives,  including  under  that  head  the  moral  feelings  of  the  time  and  the society  to  which  he  belongs.  The  Sultan  could  not,  if  he  would,  change  the religion  of  the  Mohammedan  world,  but  even  if  he  could  do  so,  it  is  in  the very highest degree improbable that the head of Mohammedanism should wish to  overthrow  the  religion  of  Mohammed ;  the  internal  check  on  the  exercise of the Sultan\u2019s power is at least as strong as the external limitation. People sometimes  ask  the  idle  question,  why  the  Pope  does  not  introduce  this  or that reform ? The true answer is that a revolutionist is not the kind of man who  becomes  a  Pope  and  that  a  man  who  becomes  a  Pope  has  no  wish  to be  a  revolutionist.\u201d  I  think,  these  remarks  apply  equally  to  the  Brahmins of  India  and  one  can  say  with  equal  truth  that  if  a  man  who  becomes  a Pope has no wish to become a revolutionary, a man who is born a Brahmin"

To  take  this  view  is  in  my  judgment  to  ignore  the  part  played by  the  intellectual  class  in  the  community.  Whether  you  accept  the  theory of  the  great  man  as  the  maker  of  history  or  whether  you  do  not,  this  much you  will  have  to  concede  that  in  every  country  the  intellectual  class  is  the most  influential  class,  if  not  the  governing  class.  The  intellectual  class  is the  class  which  can  foresee,  it  is  the  class  which  can  advise  and  give  lead. In no country does the mass of the people live the life of intelligent thought and  action.  It  is  largely  imitative  and  follows  the  intellectual  class.  There is  no  exaggeration  in  saying  that  the  entire  destiny  of  a  country  depends upon its intellectual class. If the intellectual class is honest, independent and disinterested  it  can  be  trusted  to  take  the  initiative  and  give  a  proper  lead when  a  crisis  arises.  It  is  true  that  intellect  by  itself  is  no  virtue.  It  is  only a means and the use of means depends upon the ends which an intellectual person pursues. An intellectual man can be a good man but he can easily be a rogue. Similarly an intellectual class may be a band of high-souled persons, ready  to  help,  ready  to  emancipate  erring  humanity  or  it  may  easily  be  a gang of crooks or a body of advocates of a narrow clique from which it draws its  support.  You  may  think  it  a  pity  that  the  intellectual  class  in  India  is simply  another  name  for  the  Brahmin  caste.  You  may  regret  that  the  two are  one ;  that  the  existence  of  the  intellectual  class  should  be  bound  with one single caste, that this intellectual class should share the interest and the aspirations  of  that  Brahmin  caste,  which  has  regarded  itself  the  custodian of  the  interest  of  that  caste,  rather  than  of  the  interests  of  the  country.  All this may be very regrettable. But the fact remains, that the Brahmins form the  intellectual  class  of  the  Hindus.  It  is  not  only  an  intellectual  class  but it is a class which is held in great reverence by the rest of the Hindus. The Hindus  are  taught  that  the  Brahmins  are  Bhudevas  (Gods  on  earth) o.kkZuke~ czk\u00e3.k A xq#_ The Hindus are taught that Brahmins alone can be their teachers. Manu  says,  \u201cIf  it  be  asked  how  it  should  be  with  respect  to  points  of  the Dharma which have not been specially mentioned, the answer is that which Brahmins  who  are  Shishthas  propound  shall  doubtless  have  legal  force.\u201d :"

In  one  of  its aspects,  it  divides  men  into  separate  communities.  In  its  second  aspect,  it places  these  communities  in  a  graded  order  one  above  the  other  in  social status. Each caste takes its pride and its consolation in the fact that in the scale  of  castes  it  is  above  some  other  caste.  As  an  outward  mark  of  this gradation, there is also a gradation of social and religious rights technically spoken of an Ashta-dhikaras and Sanskaras. The higher the grade of a caste, the  greater  the  number  of  these  rights  and  the  lower  the  grade,  the  lesser their number. Now this gradation, this scaling of castes, makes it impossible to  organise  a  common  front  against  the  Caste  System.  If  a  caste  claims the  right  to  inter-dine  and  inter-marry  with  another  caste  placed  above  it, it  is  frozen,  instantly  it  is  told  by  mischief-mongers,  and  there  are  many Brahmins amongst such mischief-mongers, that it will have to concede inter- dining  and  inter-marriage  with  castes  below  it!  All  are  slaves  of  the  Caste System.  But  all  the  slaves  are  not  equal  in  status.  To  excite  the  proletariat to  bring  about  an  economic  revolution,  Karl  Marx  told  them :  \u201cYou  have nothing  to  lose  except  your  chains.\u201d  But  the  artful  way  in  which  the  social and  religious  rights  are  distributed  among  the  different  castes  whereby some  have  more  and  some  have  less,  makes  the  slogan  of  Karl  Marx  quite useless to excite the Hindus against the Caste System. Castes form a graded system of sovereignties, high and low, which are jealous of their status and which  know  that  if  a  general  dissolution  came,  some  of  them  stand  to  lose more of their prestige and power than others do. You cannot, therefore, have a  general  mobilization  of  the  Hindus,  to  use  a  military  expression,  for  an attack  on  the  Caste  System."

The  Caste  and  Varna  are  matters, which are dealt with by the Vedas and the Smritis and consequently, appeal to  reason  can  have  no  effect  on  a  Hindu.  So  far  as  Caste  and  Varna  are concerned, not only the Shastras do not permit the Hindu to use his reason in  the  decision  of  the  question,  but  they  have  taken  care  to  see  that  no occasion  is  left  to  examine  in  a  rational  way  the  foundations  of  his  belief in  Caste  and  Varna.  It  must  be  a  source  of  silent  amusement  to  many a  Non-Hindu  to  find  hundreds  and  thousands  of  Hindus  breaking  Caste on  certain  occasions,  such  as  railway  journey  and  foreign  travel  and  yet endeavouring  to  maintain  Caste  for  the  rest  of  their  lives!  The  explanation of  this  phenomenon  discloses  another  fetter  on  the  reasoning  faculties  of the  Hindus.  Man\u2019s  life  is  generally  habitual  and  unreflective.  Reflective thought,  in  the  sense  of  active,  persistent  and  careful  consideration  of  any belief or supposed form or knowledge in the light of the grounds that support it  and  further  conclusions  to  which  it  tends,  is  quite  rare  and  arises  only in  a  situation  which  presents  a  dilemma\u2014a  crisis.  Railway  journeys  and foreign  travels  are  really  occasions  of  crisis  in  the  life  of  a  Hindu  and  it  is natural  to  expect  a  Hindu  to  ask  himself  why  he  should  maintain  Caste at  all,  if  he  cannot  maintain  it  at  all  times.  But  he  does  not.  He  breaks Caste  at  one  step  and  proceeds  to  observe  it  at  the  next  without  raising any  question.  The  reason  for  this  astonishing  conduct  is  to  be  found  in the  rule  of  the  Shastras,  which  directs  him  to  maintain  Caste  as  far  as"

      "text": "Some may not understand what I mean by destruction of Religion ; some may  find  the  idea  revolting  to  them  and  some  may  find  it  revolutionary. Let  me  therefore  explain  my  position.  I  do  not  know  whether  you  draw a  distinction  between  principles  and  rules.  But  I  do.  Not  only  I  make  a distinction  but  I  say  that  this  distinction  is  real  and  important.  Rules  are practical;  they  are  habitual  ways  of  doing  things  according  to  prescription. But  principles  are  intellectual;  they  are  useful  methods  of  judging  things. Rules  seek  to  tell  an  agent  just  what  course  of  action  to  pursue.  Principles do  not  prescribe  a  specific  course  of  action.  Rules,  like  cooking  recipes,  do tell  just  what  to  do  and  how  to  do  it.  A  principle,  such  as  that  of  justice, supplies  a  main  head  by  reference  to  which  he  is  to  consider  the  bearings of  his  desires  and  purposes,  it  guides  him  in  his  thinking  by  suggesting to  him  the  important  consideration  which  he  should  bear  in  mind.  This difference  between  rules  and  principles  makes  the  acts  done  in  pursuit  of them  different  in  quality  and  in  content.  Doing  what  is  said  to  be  good  by virtue  of  a  rule  and  doing  good  in  the  light  of  a  principle  are  two  different things. The principle may be wrong but the act is conscious and responsible. The  rule  may  be  right  but  the  act  is  mechanical.  A  religious  act  may  not be  a  correct  act  but  must  at  least  be  a  responsible  act.  To  permit  of  this responsibility, Religion must mainly be a matter of principles only. It cannot be  a  matter  of  rules.  The  moment  it  degenerates  into  rules  it  ceases  to  be Religion,  as  it  kills  responsibility  which  is  the  essence  of  a  truly  religious act.  What  is  this  Hindu  Religion ?  Is  it  a  set  of  principles  or  is  it  a  code of  rules ?  Now  the  Hindu  Religion,  as  contained  in  the  Vedas  and  the Smritis,  is  nothing  but  a  mass  of  sacrificial,  social,  political  and  sanitary rules  and  regulations,  all  mixed  up.  What  is  called  Religion  by  the  Hindus is  nothing  but  a  multitude  of  commands  and  prohibitions.  Religion,  in  the sense  of  spiritual  principles,  truly  universal,  applicable  to  all  races,  to  all countries,  to  all  times,  is  not  to  be  found  in  them,  and  if  it  is,  it  does  not form the governing part of a Hindu\u2019s life. That for a Hindu, Dharma means commands and prohibitions is clear from the way the word Dharma is used in  Vedas  and  the  Smritis  and  understood  by  the  commentators.  The  word Dharma  as  used  in  the  Vedas  in  most  cases  means  religious  ordinances  or rites.  Even  Jaimini  in  his  Purva-Mimansa  defines  Dharma  as  \u201ca  desirable goal  or  result  that  is  indicated  by  injunctive  (Vedic)  passages\u201d.  To  put  it in  plain  language,  what  the  Hindus  call  Religion  is  really  Law  or  at  best legalized  class-ethics.  Frankly,  I  refuse  to  call  this  code  of  ordinances,  as Religion.

Under it,  there  is  no  loyalty  to  ideals,  there  is  only  conformity  to  commands.  But the  worst  evil  of  this  code  of  ordinances  is  that  the  laws  it  contains  must be  the  same  yesterday,  today  and  forever.  They  are  iniquitous  in  that  they are  not  the  same  for  one  class  as  for  another.  But  this  iniquity  is  made perpetual in that they are prescribed to be the same for all generations. The objectionable  part  of  such  a  scheme  is  not  that  they  are  made  by  certain persons  called  Prophets  or  Law-givers.  The  objectionable  part  is  that  this code  has  been  invested  with  the  character  of  finality  and  fixity.  Happiness notoriously varies with the conditions and circumstances of a person, as well as  with  the  conditions  of  different  people  and  epochs.  That  being  the  case, how can humanity endure this code of eternal laws, without being cramped and  without  being  crippled ?  I  have,  therefore,  no  hesitation  in  saying  that such  a  religion  must  be  destroyed  and  I  say,  there  is  nothing  irreligious  in working  for  the  destruction  of  such  a  religion.  Indeed  I  hold  that  it  is  your bounden  duty  to  tear  the  mask,  to  remove  the  misrepresentation  that  as caused by misnaming this Law as Religion. This is an essential step for you. Once  you  clear  the  minds  of  the  people  of  this  misconception  and  enable them  to  realize  that  what  they  are  told  as  Religion  is  not  Religion  but  that it  is  really  Law,  you  will  be  in  a  position  to  urge  for  its  amendment  or abolition.  So  long  as  people  look  upon  it  as  Religion  they  will  not  be  ready for a change, because the idea of Religion is generally speaking not associated with  the  idea  of  change.  But  the  idea  of  law  is  associated  with  the  idea  of change and when people come to know that what is called Religion is really Law,  old  and  archaic,  they  will  be  ready  for  a  change,  for  people  know  and accept  that  law  can  be  changed."

But as this seems to be impossible, the priesthood must at least cease to be hereditary. Every person who professes to  be  a  Hindu  must  be  eligible  for  being  a  priest.  It  should  be  provided  by law  that  no  Hindu  shall  be  entitled  to  be  a  priest  unless  he  has  passed an  examination  prescribed  by  the  State  and  holds  a  sanad  from  the  State permitting him to practise. (3) No ceremony performed by a priest who does not  hold  a  sanad  shall  be  deemed  to  be  valid  in  law  and  it  should  be  made penal  for  a  person  who  has  no  sanad  to  officiate  as  a  priest.  (4)  A  priest should  be  the  servant  of  the  State  and  should  be  subject  to  the  disciplinary action  by  the  State  in  the  matter  of  his  morals,  beliefs  and  worship,  in addition  to  his  being  subject  along  with  other  citizens  to  the  ordinary  law of the land. (5) The number of priests should be limited by law according to the  requirements  of  the  State  as  is  done  in  the  case  of  the  I.C.S.  To  some, this  may  sound  radical.  But  to  my  mind  there  is  nothing  revolutionary  in this. Every profession in India is regulated. Engineers must show proficiency, Doctor  must  show  proficiency,  Lawyers  must  show  proficiency,  before  they are  allowed  to  practise  their  professions.  During  the  whole  of  their  career, they  must  not  only  obey  the  law  of  the  land,  civil  as  well  as  criminal,  but they must also obey the special code of morals prescribed by their respective professions.  The  priest\u2019s  is  the  only  profession  where  proficiency  is  not required. The profession of a Hindu priest is the only profession which is not subject  to  any  code.  Mentally  a  priest  may  be  an  idiot,  physically  a  priest may be suffering from a foul disease, such as syphilis or gonorrhea, morally he  may  be  a  wreck.  But  he  is  fit  to  officiate  at  solemn  ceremonies,  to  enter the  sanctum  sanctorum  of  a  Hindu  temple  and  worship  the  Hindu  God.  All this  becomes  possible  among  the  Hindus  because  for  a  priest  it  is  enough to  be  born  in  a  priestly  caste.  The  whole  thing  is  abominable  and  is  due  to the  fact  that  the  priestly  class  among  Hindus  is  subject  neither  to  law  nor to  morality.  It  recognizes  no  duties.  It  knows  only  of  rights  and  privileges. It  is  a  pest  which  divinity  seems  to  have  let  loose  on  the  masses  for  their mental  and  moral  degradation.  The  priestly  class  must  be  brought  under control  by  some  such  legislation  as  I  have  outlined  above.  It  will  prevent  it from  doing  mischief  and  from  misguiding  people.  It  will  democratise  it  by throwing  it  open  to  every  one.  It  will  certainly  help  to  kill  the  Brahminism and will also help to kill Caste, which is nothing but Brahminism incarnate. Brahminism  is  the  poison  which  has  spoiled  Hinduism.  You  will  succeed  in saving Hinduism if you will kill Brahminism. There should be no opposition to  this  reform  from  any  quarter.  It  should  be  welcomed  even  by  the  Arya Samajists,  because  this  is  merely  an  application  of  their  own  doctrine  of guna-karma."

As  a  society  becomes  more  enlightened,  it realizes  that  it  is  responsible  not  to  conserve  and  transmit  the  whole  of  its existing  achievements,  but  only  such  as  make  for  a  better  future  society.\u201d Even Burke, in spite of the vehemence with which he opposed the principle of  change  embodied  in  the  French  Revolution,  was  compelled  to  admit  that \u201ca  State  without  the  means  of  some  change  is  without  the  means  of  its conservation.  Without  such  means  it  might  even  risk  the  loss  of  that  part of  the  constitution  which  it  wished  the  most  religiously  to  preserve.\u201d  What Burke  said  of  a  State  applies  equally  to  a  society."

The beneful effect of this worship of the past are  best  summed  up  by  Prof.  Dewey  when  he  says :  \u201cAn  individual  can  live only in the present. The present is not just something which comes after the past;  much  less  something  produced  by  it.  It  is  what  life  is  in  leaving  the past  behind  it.  The  study  of  past  products  will  not  help  us  to  understand the present. A knowledge of the past and its heritage is of great significance when it enters into the present, but not otherwise. And the mistake of making the  records  and  remains  of  the  past  the  main  material  of  education  is  that it  tends  to  make  the  past  a  rival  of  the  present  and  the  present  a  more  or less  futile  imitation  of  the  past.\u201d  The  principle,  which  makes  little  of  the present act of living and growing, naturally looks upon the present as empty and upon the future as remote.

All  I  claim  is  to  have  told  you  candidly  my  views.  I  have  little  to recommend them but some study and a deep concern in your destiny. If you will  allow  me  to  say,  these  views  are  the  views  of  a  man,  who  has  been  no tool of power, no flatterer of greatness. They come from one, almost the whole of whose public exertion has been one continuous struggle for liberty for the poor  and  for  the  oppressed  and  whose  only  reward  has  been  a  continuous shower  of  calumny  and  abuse  from  national  journals  and  national  leaders, for no other reason except that I refuse to join with them in performing the miracle\u2014I  will  not  say  trick\u2014of  liberating  the  oppressed  with  the  gold  of the  tyrant  and  raising  the  poor  with  the  cash  of  the  rich.  All  this  may  not be  enough  to  commend  my  views.  I  think  they  are  not  likely  to  alter  yours. But whether they do or do not, the responsibility is entirely yours. You must make your efforts to uproot Caste, if not in my way, then in your way. I am sorry, I will not be with you. I have decided to change. This is not the place for  giving  reasons.  But  even  when  I  am  gone  out  of  your  fold,  I  will  watch your  movement  with  active  sympathy  and  you  will  have  my  assistance  for what it may be worth. Yours is a national cause. Caste is no doubt primarily the  breath  of  the  Hindus.  But  the  Hindus  have  fouled  the  air  all  over  and everybody  is  infected,  Sikh,  Muslim  and  Christian.  You,  therefore,  deserve the  support  of  all  those  who  are  suffering  from  this  infection,  Sikh,  Muslim and Christian. Yours is more difficult than the other national cause, namely Swaraj. In the fight for Swaraj you fight with the whole nation on your side. In  this,  you  have  to  fight  against  the  whole  nation  and  that  too,  your  own. But  it  is  more  important  than  Swaraj.  There  is  no  use  having  Swaraj,  if you cannot defend it. More important than the question of defending Swaraj is  the  question  of  defending  the  Hindus  under  the  Swaraj.  In  my  opinion only  when  the  Hindu  Society  becomes  a  casteless  society  that  it  can  hope to  have  strength  enough  to  defend  itself.  Without  such  internal  strength, Swaraj for Hindus may turn out to be only a step towards slavery. Good-bye and  good  wishes  for  your  success."

But  I  do  know  that  it  is  harmful  both  to  spiritual  and  national  growth. Varna  and  Ashrama  are  institutions  which  have  nothing  to  do  with  castes. The law of Varna teaches us that we have each one of us to earn our bread by  following  the  ancestral  calling.  It  defines  not  our  rights  but  our  duties. It  necessarily  has  reference  to  callings  that  are  conducive  to  the  welfare of  humanity  and  to  no  other.  It  also  follows  that  there  is  no  calling  too low  and  none  too  high.  All  are  good,  lawful  and  absolutely  equal  in  status. The  callings  of  a  Brahmin\u2014spiritual  teacher\u2014and  a  scavenger  are  equal, and  their  due  performance  carries  equal  merit  before  God  and  at  one  time seems  to  have  carried  identical  reward  before  man.  Both  were  entitled  to their  livelihood  and  no  more.  Indeed  one  traces  even  now  in  the  villages the  faint  lines  of  this  healthy  operation  of  the  law.  Living  in  Segaon  with its  population  of  600,  I  do  not  find  a  great  disparity  between  the  earnings of  different  tradesmen  including  Brahmins.  I  find  too  that  real  Brahmins are to be found even in these degenerate days who are living on alms freely given to them and are giving freely of what they have of spiritual treasures. It would be wrong and improper to judge the law of Varna by its caricature in  the  lives  of  men  who  profess  to  belong  to  a  Varna,  whilst  they  openly commit a breach of its only operative rule. Arrogation of a superior status by and  of  the  Varna  over  another  is  a  denial  of  the  law.  And  there  is  nothing in  the  law  of  Varna  to  warrant  a  belief  in  untouchability.

From  a  perusal  of  his  review  of  my  speech  it  is  clear  that the  Mahatma  completely  dissents  from  the  views  I  have  expressed  on  the subject  of  Caste.  I  am  not  in  the  habit  of  entering  into  controversy  with my  opponents  unless  there  are  special  reasons  which  compel  me  to  act otherwise.

While  I  appreciate  the  honour  he  has  done  me,  I  must  confess  to a  sense  of  surprize  on  finding  that  of  all  the  persons  the  Mahatma  should accuse  me  of  a  desire  to  seek  publicity  as  he  seems  to  do  when  he  suggests that  in  publishing  the  undelivered  speech  my  object  was  to  see  that  I  was not  \u201cforgotten\u201d.

It  is  incapable  of  sustaining itself  by  its  own  virtue  and  has  an  inherent  tendency  to  degenerate  into  a caste system unless there is a legal sanction behind it which can be enforced against every one transgressing his Varna ; (3) That the reorganization of the Hindu Society on the basis of Chaturvarnya is harmful because the effect of the Varnavyavastha is to degrade the masses by denying them opportunity to acquire knowledge and to emasculate them by denying them the right to be armed ; (4) That the Hindu society must be reorganized on a religious basis which  would  recognise  the  principles  of  Liberty,  Equality  and  Fraternity; (5) That in order to achieve this object the sense of religious sanctity behind"

I  confess  I  am  no  authority  on  this  matter.  But  I  should  like  to state that the texts cited by me are all taken from the writings of the late Mr.  Tilak  who  was  a  recognised  authority  on  the  Sanskrit  language  and on  the  Hindu  Shastras.  His  second  point  is  that  these  Shastras  should  be interpreted  not  by  the  learned  but  the  saints  and  that,  as  the  saints  have understood them, the Shastras do not support Caste and Untouchability. As regards the first point what I like to ask the Mahatma is what does it avail to  any  one  if  the  texts  are  interpolations  and  if  they  have  been  differently interpreted by the saints ? The masses do not make any distinction between texts which are genuine and texts which are interpolations. The masses do not  know  what  the  texts  are.  They  are  too  illiterate  to  know  the  contents of  the  Shastras.  They  have  believed  what  they  have  been  told  and  what they  have  been  told  is  that  the  Shastras  do  enjoin  as  a  religious  duty  the observance  of  Caste  and  Untouchability."

They  have been  ineffective  for  two  reasons.  Firstly,  none  of  the  saints  ever  attacked the  Caste  System.  On  the  contrary,  they  were  staunch  believers  in  the System  of  Castes.  Most  of  them  lived  and  died  as  members  of  the  castes which  they  respectively  belonged.  So  passionately  attached  was  Jnyandeo to  his  status  as  a  Brahmin  that  when  the  Brahmins  of  Paithan  would not  admit  him  to  their  fold  he  moved  heaven  and  earth  to  get  his  status as  a  Brahmin  recognized  by  the  Brahmin  fraternity.  And  even  the  saint Eknath  who  now  figures  in  the  film  \u201cDharmatma\u201d  as  a  hero  for  having shown  courage  to  touch  the  untouchables  and  dine  with  them,  did  so  not because  he  was  opposed  to  Caste  and  Untouchability  but  because  he  felt that  the  pollution  caused  thereby  could  be  washed  away  by  a  bath  in  the sacred  waters  of  the  river  Ganges.*  The  saints  have  never  according  to my  study  carried  on  a  campaign  against  Caste  and  Untouchability.  They were  not  concerned  with  the  struggle  between  men.  They  were  concerned with the relation between man and God. They did not preach that all men were  equal.  They  preached  that  all  men  were  equal  in  the  eyes  of  God\u2014"

The  second  reason  why  the teachings of the saints proved ineffective was because the masses have been taught  that  a  saint  might  break  Caste  but  the  common  man  must  not.  A saint  therefore  never  became  an  example  to  follow.  He  always  remained  a pious man to be honoured. That the masses have remained staunch believers in  Caste  and  Untouchability  shows  that  the  pious  lives  and  noble  sermons of  the  saints  have  had  no  effect  on  their  life  and  conduct  as  against  the teachings  of  the  Shastras.  Thus  it  can  be  a  matter  of  no  consolation  that there were saints or that there is a Mahatma who understands the Shastras differently  from  the  learned  few  or  ignorant  many.  That  the  masses  hold different  view  of  the  Shastras  is  fact  which  should  and  must  be  reckoned with.  How  is  that  to  be  dealt  with  except  by  denouncing  the  authority  of the  Shastras,  which  continue  to  govern  their  conduct,  is  a  question  which the Mahatma has not considered. But whatever the plan the Mahatma puts forth  as  an  effective  means  to  free  the  masses  from  the  teachings  of  the Shastras, he must accept that the pious life led by one good Samaritan may be very elevating to himself but in India, with the attitude the common man has  to  saints  and  to  Mahatmas\u2014to  honour  but  not  to  follow\u2014one  cannot make  much  out  of  it."

I  agree  with  every  word  of  this  statement.  But  I  do  not  quite understand what the Mahatma wishes to prove thereby. That religion should be judged not by its worst specimens but by its best is true enough but does it dispose of the matter ? I say it does not. The question still remains\u2014why the  worst  number  so  many  and  the  best  so  few ?  To  my  mind  there  are two  conceivable  answers  to  this  question :  (1)  That  the  worst  by  reason  of some  original  perversity  of  theirs  are  morally  uneducable  and  are  therefore incapable of making the remotest approach to the religious ideal. Or (2) That the  religious  ideal  is  a  wholly  wrong  ideal  which  has  given  a  wrong  moral twist  to  the  lives  of  the  many  and  that  the  best  have  become  best  in  spite of  the  wrong  ideal\u2014in  fact  by  giving  to  the  wrong  twist  a  turn  in  the  right direction.  Of  these  two  explanations  I  am  not  prepared  to  accept  the  first and I am sure that even the Mahatma will not insist upon the contrary. To my  mind  the  second  is  the  only  logical  and  reasonable  explanation  unless the Mahatma has a third alternative to explain why the worst are so many and  the  best  so  few.  If  the  second  is  the  only  explanation  then  obviously the  argument  of  the  Mahatma  that  a  religion  should  be  judged  by  its  best followers  carries  us  nowhere  except  to  pity  the  lot  of  the  many  who  have gone  wrong  because  they  have  been  made  to  worship  wrong  ideals."

I am totally opposed to this kind of ideology. I can respect those of the caste Hindus who try to realize a high social ideal in their life. Without  such  men  India  would  be  an  uglier  and  a  less  happy  place  to  live in  than  it  is.  But  nonetheless  anyone  who  relies  on  an  attempt  to  turn  the members  of  the  caste  Hindus  into  better  men  by  improving  their  personal character  is  in  my  judgment  wasting  his  energy  and  hugging  an  illusion. Can  personal  character  make  the  maker  of  armaments  a  good  man,  i.e.  a man  who  will  sell  shells  that  will  not  burst  and  gas  that  will  not  poison ? If  it  cannot,  how  can  you  accept  personal  character  to  make  a  man  loaded with the consciousness of Caste, a good man, i.e. a man who would treat his fellows  as  his  friends  and  equals ?  To  be  true  to  himself  he  must  deal  with his  fellows  either  as  a  superior  or  inferior  according  as  the  case  may  be;  at any  rate,  differently  from  his  own  caste  fellows.  He  can  never  be  expected to  deal  with  his  fellows  as  his  kinsmen  and  equals.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  a Hindu  does  treat  all  those  who  are  not  of  his  Caste  as  though  they  were aliens, who could be discriminated against with impunity and against whom any fraud or trick may be practised without shame. This is to say that there can  be  a  better  or  a  worse  Hindu.  But  a  good  Hindu  there  cannot  be.  This is  so  not  because  there  is  anything  wrong  with  his  personal  character.  In fact  what  is  wrong  is  the  entire  basis  of  his  relationship  to  his  fellows.  The best  of  men  cannot  be  moral  if  the  basis  of  relationship  between  them  and their  fellows  is  fundamentally  a  wrong  relationship.  To  a  slave  his  master may  be  better  or  worse.  But  there  cannot  be  a  good  master.  A  good  man cannot  be  a  master  and  a  master  cannot  be  a  good  man.  The  same  applies to  the  relationship  between  high  caste  and  low  caste.  To  a  low  caste  man a  high  caste  man  can  be  better  or  worse  as  compared  to  other  high  caste men.  A  high  caste  man  cannot  be  a  good  man  in  so  far  as  he  must  have a  low  caste  man  to  distinguish  him  as  high  caste  man.  It  cannot  be  good to  a  low  caste  man  to  be  conscious  that  there  is  a  high  caste  man  above him.  I  have  argued  in  my  speech  that  a  society  based  on  Varna  or  Caste is  a  society  which  is  based  on  a  wrong  relationship.  I  had  hoped  that  the Mahatma  would  attempt  to  demolish  my  argument.  But  instead  of  doing that  he  has  merely  reiterated  his  belief  in  Chaturvarnya  without  disclosing the  ground  on  which  it  is  based"

But when  one  preaches  a  doctrine  and  holds  it  as  a  dogma  there  is  a  curiosity to  know  how  far  he  practises  what  he  preaches.  It  may  be  that  his  failure to  practise  is  due  to  the  ideal  being  too  high  to  be  attainable ;  it  may  be that  his  failure  to  practise  is  due  to  the  innate  hypocracy  of  the  man.  In any  case  he  exposes  his  conduct  to  examination  and  I  must  not  be  blamed if  I  asked  how  far  has  the  Mahatma  attempted  to  realize  his  ideal  in  his own  case.  The  Mahatma  is  a  Bania  by  birth.  His  ancestors  had  abandoned trading  in  favour  of  ministership  which  is  a  calling  of  the  Brahmins.  In his  own  life,  before  he  became  a  Mahatma,  when  occasion  came  for  him  to choose his career he preferred law to scales. On abandoning law he became half  saint  and  half  politician.  He  has  never  touched  trading  which  is  his ancestral  calling.  His  youngest  son\u2014I  take  one  who  is  a  faithful  follower of  his  father\u2014born  a  Vaishya  has  married  a  Brahmin\u2019s  daughter  and  has chosen  to  serve  a  newspaper  magnate.  The  Mahatma  is  not  known  to  have condemned  him  for  not  following  his  ancestral  calling.  It  may  be  wrong and  uncharitable  to  judge  an  ideal  by  its  worst  specimens.  But  surely the  Mahatma  as  a  specimen  has  no  better  and  if  he  even  fails  to  realize the  ideal  then  the  ideal  must  be  an  impossible  ideal  quite  opposed  to  the practical  instincts  of  man.  Students  of  Carlyle  know  that  he  often  spoke on  a  subject  before  he  thought  about  it.  I  wonder  whether  such  has  not been  the  case  with  the  Mahatma  in  regard  to  the  subject  matter  of  Caste. Otherwise certain questions which occur to me would not have escaped him. When  can  a  calling  be  deemed  to  have  become  an  ancestral  calling  so  as to  make  it  binding  on  a  man ?  Must  man  follow  his  ancestral  calling  even if  it  does  not  suit  his  capacities,  even  when  it  has  ceased  to  be  profitable ? Must  a  man  live  by  his  ancestral  calling  even  if  he  finds  it  to  be  immoral ? If  every  one  must  pursue  his  ancestral  calling  then  it  must  follow  that  a man  must  continue  to  be  a  pimp  because  his  grandfather  was  a  pimp  and a  woman  must  continue  to  be  a  prostitute  because  her  grandmother  was  a prostitute.  Is  the  Mahatma  prepared  to  accept  the  logical  conclusion  of  his doctrine ?  To  me  his  ideal  of  following  one\u2019s  ancestral  calling  is  not  only  an impossible and impractical ideal, but it is also morally an indefensible ideal."

      "text": "freely given to them and giving freely what they have of spiritual treasures\u201d. This is how a hereditary Brahmin priest appears to the Mahatma\u2014a carrier of  spiritual  treasures.  But  another  portrait  of  the  hereditary  Brahmin  can also  be  drawn.  A  Brahmin  can  be  a  priest  to  Vishnu\u2014the  God  of  Love.  He can  be  a  priest  to  Shankar\u2014the  God  of  Destruction.  He  can  be  a  priest  at Buddha  Gaya  worshipping  Buddha\u2014the  greatest  teacher  of  mankind  who taught  the  noblest  doctrine  of  Love.  He  also  can  be  a  priest  to  Kali,  the Goddess,  who  must  have  a  daily  sacrifice  of  an  animal  to  satisfy  her  thirst for blood ; He will be a priest of the temple of Rama\u2014the Kshatriya God! He will  also  be  a  priest  of  the  Temple  of  Parshuram,  the  God  who  took  Avatar to  destroy  the  Kshatriyas  !  He  can  be  a  priest  to  Bramha,  the  Creator  of the  world.  He  can  be  a  priest  to  a  Pir  whose  God  Allah  will  not  brook  the claim of Bramha to share his spiritual dominion over the world! No one can say  that  this  is  a  picture  which  is  not  true  to  life.  If  this  is  a  true  picture one  does  not  know  what  to  say  of  this  capacity  to  bear  loyalties  to  Gods and  Goddesses  whose  attributes  are  so  antagonistic  that  no  honest  man can  be  a  devotee  to  all  of  them.  The  Hindus  rely  upon  this  extraordinary phenomenon  as  evidence  of  the  greatest  virtue  of  their  religion\u2014namely its  catholicity,  its  spirit  of  toleration.  As  against  this  facile  view,  it  can  be urged  that  what  is  toleration  and  catholicity  may  be  really  nothing  more creditable than indifference or flaccid latitudinarianism. These two attitudes are hard to distinguish in their outer seeming. But they are so vitally unlike in  their  real  quality  that  no  one  who  examines  them  closely  can  mistake one  for  the  other.  That  a  man  is  ready  to  render  homage  to  many  Gods and  Goddesses  may  be  cited  as  evidence  of  his  tolerant  spirit.  But  can  it not also be evidence of insincerity born of a desire to serve the times ? I am sure  that  this  toleration  is  merely  insincerity.  If  this  view  is  well  founded, one  may  ask  what  spiritual  treasure  can  there  be  with  a  person  who  is ready  to  be  a  priest  and  a  devotee  to  any  deity  which  it  serves  his  purpose to  worship  and  to  adore ?  Not  only  must  such  a  person  be  deemed  to  be bankrupt  of  all  spiritual  treasures  but  for  him  to  practice  so  elevating  a profession  as  that  of  a  priest  simply  because  it  is  ancestral,  without  faith, without  belief,  merely  as  a  mechanical  process  handed  down  from  father  to son,  is  not  a  conservation  of  virtue;  it  is  really  the  prostitution  of  a  noble profession  which  is  no  other  than  the  service  of  religion."

Everybody  wants  social  stability  and  some  adjustment must be made in the relationship between individuals and classes in order that  stability  may  be  had.  But  two  things,  I  am  sure  nobody  wants.  One thing  nobody  wants  is  static  relationship,  something  that  is  unalterable, something that is fixed for all times. Stability is wanted but not at the cost of  change  when  change  is  imperative.  Second  thing  nobody  wants  is  mere adjustment. Adjustment is wanted but not at the sacrifice of social justice. Can  it  be  said  that  the  adjustment  of  social  relationship  on  the  basis  of caste  i.e.  on  the  basis  of  each  to  his  hereditary  calling  avoids  these  two evils ?  I  am  convinced  that  it  does  not.  Far  from  being  the  best  possible adjustment  I  have  no  doubt  that  it  is  of  the  worst  possible  kind  inasmuch as it offends against both the canons of social adjustment\u2014namely fluidity and  equity."

      "text": "Some might think that the Mahatma has made much progress inasmuch as  he  now  only  believes  in  Varna  and  does  not  believe  in  Caste.  It  is true  that  there  was  a  time  when  the  Mahatma  was  a  full-blooded  and  a blue-blooded  Sanatani  Hindu.  He  believed  in  the  Vedas,  the  Upanishads, the  Puranas  and  all  that  goes  by  the  name  of  Hindu  scriptures  and therefore  in  avatars  and  rebirth.  He  believed  in  Caste  and  defended  it with  the  vigour  of  the  orthodox.  He  condemned  the  cry  for  inter-dining, inter-drinking  and  inter-marrying  and  argued  that  restraints  about  inter- dining  to  a  great  extent  \u201chelped  the  cultivation  of  will-power  and  the conservation  of  certain  social  virtue\u201d.  It  is  good  that  he  has  repudiated this  sanctimonious  nonsense  and  admitted  that  caste  \u201cis  harmful  both  to spiritual  and  national  growth,\u201d  and  may  be,  his  son\u2019s  marriage  outside his  caste  has  had  something  to  do  with  this  change  of  view.  But  has  the Mahatma  really  progressed ?  What  is  the  nature  of  the  Varna  for  which the  Mahatma  stands ?  Is  it  the  Vedic  conception  as  commonly  understood and  preached  by  Swami  Dayanand  Saraswati  and  his  followers,  the  Arya Samajists ?  The  essence  of  the  Vedic  conception  of  Varna  is  the  pursuit  of a calling which is appropriate to one\u2019s natural aptitude. The essence of the Mahatma\u2019s conception of Varna is the pursuit of ancestral calling irrespective of  natural  aptitude.  What  is  the  difference  between  Caste  and  Varna  as understood  by  the  Mahatma ?  I  find  none.  As  defined  by  the  Mahatma, Varna  becomes  merely  a  different  name  for  Caste  for  the  simple  reason that  it  is  the  same  in  essence\u2014namely  pursuit  of  ancestral  calling.  Far from making progress the Mahatma has suffered retrogression. By putting this interpretation upon the Vedic conception of Varna he has really made ridiculous  what  was  sublime.  While  I  reject  the  Vedic  Varnavyavastha  for reasons  given  in  the  speech  I  must  admit  that  the  Vedic  theory  of  Varna as  interpreted  by  Swami  Dayanand  and  some  others  is  a  sensible  and  an inoffensive  thing.  It  did  not  admit  birth  as  a  determining  factor  in  fixing"

      "text": "the place of an individual in society. It only recognized worth. The Mahatma\u2019s view  of  Varna  not  only  makes  nonsense  of  the  Vedic  Varna  but  it  makes it  an  abominable  thing.  Varna  and  Caste  are  two  very  different  concepts. Varna is based on the principle of each according to his worth-while Caste is  based  on  the  principle  of  each  according  to  his  birth.  The  two  are  as distinct  as  chalk  is  from  cheese.  In  fact  there  is  an  antithesis  between the  two.  If  the  Mahatma  believes  as  he  does  in  every  one  following  his or  her  ancestral  calling,  then  most  certainly  he  is  advocating  the  Caste System  and  that  in  calling  it  the  Varna  System  he  is  not  only  guilty  of terminological inexactitude, but he is causing confusion worse confounded. I  am  sure  that  all  his  confusion  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  Mahatma  has no  definite  and  clear  conception  as  to  what  is  Varna  and  what  is  Caste and  as  to  the  necessity  of  either  for  the  conservation  of  Hinduism.  He  has said and one hopes that he will not find some mystic reason to change his view  that  caste  is  not  the  essence  of  Hinduism.  Does  he  regard  Varna  as the  essence  of  Hinduism ?  One  cannot  as  yet  give  any  categorical  answer. Readers of his article on \u201cDr. Ambedkar\u2019s Indictment\u201d will answer \u201cNo\u201d. In that  article  he  does  not  say  that  the  dogma  of  Varna  is  an  essential  part of the creed of Hinduism. Far from making Varna the essence of Hinduism he  says  \u201cthe  essence  of  Hinduism  is  contained  in  its  enunciation  of  one and  only  God  as  Truth  and  its  bold  acceptance  of  Ahimsa  as  the  law  of the human family\u201d But the readers of his article in reply to Mr. Sant Ram will  say  \u201cYes\u201d.  In  that  article  he  says  \u201cHow  can  a  Muslim  remain  one  if he  rejects  the  Quran,  or  a  Christian  remain  as  Christian  if  he  rejects the  Bible ?  If  Caste  and  Varna  are  convertible  terms  and  if  Varna  is  an integral  part  of  the  Shastras  which  define  Hinduism  I  do  not  know  how  a person  who  rejects  Caste,  i.e.  Varna  can  call  himself  a  Hindu ?\u201d  Why  this prevarication ?  Why  does  the  Mahatma  hedge ?  Whom  does  he  want  to please ? Has the saint failed to sense the truth ? Or does the politician stand in  the  way  of  the  Saint ?  The  real  reason  why  the  Mahatma  is  suffering from this confusion is probably to be traced to two sources. The first is the temperament  of  the  Mahatma.  He  has  almost  in  everything  the  simplicity of the child with the child\u2019s capacity for self-deception. Like a child he can believe  in  anything  he  wants  to  believe.  We  must  therefore  wait  till  such time  as  it  pleases  the  Mahatma  to  abandon  his  faith  in  Varna  as  it  has pleased  him  to  abandon  his  faith  in  Caste.  The  second  source  of  confusion is the double role which the Mahatma wants to play\u2014of a Mahatma and a Politician. As a Mahatma he may be trying to spiritualize Politics. Whether he  has  succeeded  in  it  or  not  Politics  have  certainly  commercialized  him. A  politician  must  knew  that  Society  cannot  bear  the  whole  truth  and  that he  must  not  speak  the  whole  truth;  if  he  is  speaking  the  whole  truth  it is  bad  for  his  politics.  The  reason  why  the  Mahatma  is  always  supporting Caste  and  Varna  is  because  he  is  afraid  that  if  he  opposed  them  he  will lose his place in politics. Whatever may be the source of this confusion the"

The  complaint  that  my  standards  are  high may be true. But the question is not whether they are high or whether they are  low.  The  question  is  whether  they  are  the  right  standards  to  apply. A  People  and  their  Religion  must  be  judged  by  social  standards  based  on social  ethics.  No  other  standard  would  have  any  meaning  if  religion  is  held to  be  a  necessary  good  for  the  well-being  of  the  people.  Now  I  maintain that  the  standards  I  have  applied  to  test  Hindus  and  Hinduism  are  the most  appropriate  standards  and  that  I  know  of  none  that  are  better.  The conclusion  that  every  known  religion  would  fail  if  tested  by  my  standards may  be  true.  But  this  fact  should  not  give  the  Mahatma  as  the  champion of  Hindus  and  Hinduism  a  ground  for  comfort  any  more  than  the  existence of  one  madman  should  give  comfort  to  another  madman  or  the  existence  of one  criminal  should  give  comfort  to  another  criminal.  I  like  to  assure  the Mahatma that it is not the mere failure of the Hindus and Hinduism which has  produced  in  me  the  feelings  of  disgust  and  contempt  with  which  I  am charged.  I  realize  that  the  world  is  a  very  imperfect  world  and  any  one who  wants  to  live  in  it  must  bear  with  its  imperfections.  But  while  I  am prepared  to  bear  with  the  imperfections  and  shortcomings  of  the  society  in which  I  may  be  destined  to  labour,  I  feel  I  should  not  consent  to  live  in  a society  which  cherishes  wrong  ideals  or  a  society  which  having  right  ideals will  not  consent  to  bring  its  social  life  in  conformity  with  those  ideals.  If  I am  disgusted  with  Hindus  and  Hinduism  it  is  because  I  am  convinced  that they  cherish  wrong  ideals  and  live  a  wrong  social  life.  My  quarrel  with Hindus  and  Hinduism  is  not  over  the  imperfections  of  their  social  conduct. It  is  much  more  fundamental.  It  is  over  their  ideals."

It is  impossible  to  say  that  they  have  undergone  the  preliminary  intellectual regeneration.

The  Mahatma  is  no  exception.  The  Mahatma appears  not  to  believe  in  thinking.  He  prefers  to  follow  the  saints.  Like  a conservative  with  his  reverence  for  consecrated  notions  he  is  afraid  that  if he once starts thinking, many ideals and institutions to which he clings wilt be  doomed.  One  must  sympathize  with  him.  For  every  act  of  independent thinking  puts  some  portion  of  apparently  stable  world  in  peril.  But  it  is equally  true  that  dependence  on  saints  cannot  lead  us  to  knew  the  truth.
